<p class="post-intro">Bengali’s favourite hilsa deep-fried in mustard oil until crunchy and sizzling. Serve this with a drizzle of the oil and green chillies.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>lish Bhaja is Ilish in its simplest form. Bengalis love their fried fish, but very few things come close to the fatty Hilsa seasoned with just salt and turmeric, then fried in mustard oil until crunchy. The mustard oil gets flavoured with the rendered fat from the fish, and is then drizzled on top of steaming white rice and served alongside the ilish with some salt and hot green chillies.</p>
<p>Something like this does not really need a recipe, yet, no document on Bengali food would be complete without the simple joys of life like this one. Yes, we love our Ilish Paturi, Ilish Bhapa, Ilish Tel Jhol with Brinjal, but Ilish Bhaja has a place of its own in the heart of a Bengali.</p>

<li>Coat the ilish steaks with salt and turmeric and massage to cover the cavities well.</li>
<li>Heat a kadai with 2 cm deep mustard oil. Wait till the oil starts smoking and changes colour to pale yellow and the smell of the raw oil goes away. Use a small kadai to avoid using too much oil. The oil gets flavoured with the fat rendered from the fish. Too much oil will lead to flavourless oil.</li>
<li>Reduce the flame now and wait for the oil to stop smoking. Now add the fish pieces carefully.</li>
<li>Fry each side until brown. Unlike for jhol (curry) where ilish is lightly fried, for bhaja (fry) the fish must be crisp and golden.</li>
<li>Optionally, add a couple of green chillies towards the end to flavour the oil and the fish. </li>
<li>Drain the fish and serve hot with steaming hot rice, green chillies and salt. Drizzle a tablespoon of the frying oil on top of the rice. </li>

<p class="post-intro">This prized Bengali recipe for hilsa steamed in mustard sauce looks gorgeous, but cooks quickly. Perfect for dazzling guests!</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>lish bhaape, also known as Shorshe lish bhapa (or bhaape) meaning steamed mustard hilsa, is a Bengali recipe of hilsa fish (a type of shad) steamed in a potent mustard, doi (yoghurt) and coconut paste. Even though it looks very polished, it is a fairly easy recipe to execute, requiring few ingredients, no special technique, and very little time. </p>
<p>It is especially convenient for entertaining guests. You can keep everything ready in a tiffin box, and just as the guests are sitting down for the first course you can put the container to steam. It will be ready by the time the guests are finishing the vegetable courses. You can then bring this to the table and open the lid to reveal the beautiful steaming hilsa while your guests are suitably excited and impressed.</p>
<p><hr><br>Ilish or hilsa is, however, facing extinction due to high demand and overfishing. While policy initiatives between India and Bangladesh are underway to tackle this alarming situation (hilsa conservation depends a great deal on water flow in the Padma-Meghna and Hooghly-Bhagirathi river systems), we can do our bit too.</p>
<p><hr><br><strong>How can you help?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t to buy any hilsa that is under 500 g / 25 cm. Catching of hilsa before the spawning stage is detrimental to the progression of the next generation.</li>
<li>It is equally important also to not buy hilsa during the breeding season (especially October to November, but even better, until March).<br><hr><br>In 2016, Bangaldesh was able to increase its hilsa yield by 50 per cent by putting measures in place to ban fishing in the breeding season. It also laid down and imposed specifications for net size to prevent the catching of juvenile hilsa. There is a need to create more consciousness about the importance of conserving a fish that is perhaps Bengal’s greatest cultural icon.</li>

<h2 id="Method"><a href="#Method" class="headerlink" title="Method"></a>Method</h2><ol>
<li>Soak mustard seeds in water for 2 hours.</li>
<li>Clean the <em>ilish machh</em> and cut it in 3-cm thick slices. Ilish bhaape is best made with thick slices of fish. Fish without roe (eggs) is fattier and, therefore, ideal for this recipe. If your fish has eggs, remove them, as they may not cook fully when steamed. You can add them to your bhaja (fry) or jhol (curry).</li>
<li>Drain the mustard seeds of the water they’ve been soaking in and add them to a grinder jar. Add 4 green chillies, roughly chopped, along with the salt and 100g water. Grinding green chillies with the mustard ensures that it doesn’t turn bitter. </li>
<li>Grind these to a fine paste. Take your time with this process. Scrape down the sides of the jar and grind as many times as it takes to form the smoothest possible paste. The finer the grind, the better the flavours.</li>
<li>Now, add the peeled and chopped coconut to the grinder jar. Grind once again until the coconut has broken down completely. </li>
<li>Transfer this paste to a steel tiffin box. Add beaten yoghurt, sugar, turmeric, and mustard oil. Mix until the oil is fully incorporated. </li>
<li>Now add the fish, one piece at a time, and coat it with the spices. Use your hands to make sure every part of the fish, including its cavities, is well coated. </li>
<li>Slit four more green chillies and place them on the ilish pieces.</li>
<li>Fasten the lid of your tiffin box (you could also seal the top with thick aluminium foil) and set the fish aside to marinate for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Heat up your pan and place a stand at the bottom. Pour hot water, making sure it doesn’t reach up to more than half the height of your tiffin box, or there’s a danger of water seeping in. Once the water has come to a boil, place the tiffin on the stand. Cover the pan and steam on medium heat for 15 minutes. </li>
<li>Remove from the pan and allow it to rest for another 5 minutes before serving.</li>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>hilli chicken is perhaps the most popular Indo-Chinese dish found both in restaurants and street side stalls. No visit to Calcutta’s Chinatowns (especially Tangra) is complete without an order of chilli chicken. The dry chilli chicken works as a snack, appetiser as well as a side. The gravy chilli chicken is more popular as a side to either chowmein or with fried rice. There are various versions of the chilli chicken recipes. While you can play around with the sauces you like in your chilli chicken, most folks will agree that the best chilli chicken has the chicken still crispy when served. With that goal in mind we tested both the wet batter as well as the dry breading technique and finally went with breading. What yielded the crunchiest chicken was Kenji Lopez-Alt’s method which he had used in his <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/04/the-food-lab-bringing-home-general-tsos-chick.html" target="_blank" rel="external">General Tso’s Chicken recipe in Serious Eats Food Lab</a>.

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>oodh potol–this delightful Bengali niramish potol (pointed gourd or parwal) recipe is simple, quick, and tastes unbelievably good for the amount of time and effort it takes. It is a summer speciality as potol are in season. Doodh potol is made with ‘kochi’ potol or baby potol that do not yet have hard seeds. The vegetable soaks up the curry and becomes soft and juicy. Each potol, when eaten, bursts in your mouth releasing the delicate curry. Do not try and recreate this potol recipe using larger potol—it will not taste very good. This preparation is creamy yet light, and looks incredibly special even though can be put together in less than 30 minutes. A must-have during the summer months.</p>

<li>Peel the potol entirely. Even though our other potol recipes call for removing peels in alternating strips, for this recipe, we want the potol fully peeled so that it soaks up the curry and becomes juicy. Once peeled, make shallow slits on both ends to allow juices to enter the potol.</li>
<li>Heat vegetable oil in a pan. Fry the potol on medium-high heat for about 8 minutes or until the potol turn golden. Remove from the oil and set aside.</li>
<li>Temper the same oil with cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon. Add cumin powder and turmeric, and fry these spices for about 15 seconds. Take care not to burn them. </li>

<li>Add hot milk to the pan, followed by salt and sugar. Bubble everything on medium heat for 6 minutes until the potol are tender. </li>
<li>When the potol have become soft and juicy, and the milk has reduced to a creamy sauce, add ghee. Turn off the heat and rest for 2 minutes before serving.</li>

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>ifferent parts of India have their own types of phirni—Punjabi phirni and Kashmiri phirni are especially well known. This particular style of phirni is popular in Mughlai eateries in Calcutta. No biryani meal is complete without phirni for dessert.</p>
<p>After testing various proportions of rice to milk, milk to sugar, as well as testing with different types of rice, we have finally settled on a phirni recipe that is quick and easy to make, but tastes exactly like the phirni we have eaten in our favourite Mughlai eateries in Calcutta such as Aminia, Arsalan, Shiraz, Aliah, Shabir, etc. This phirni is made with very simple ingredients—rice flour, whole milk, sugar and flavouring agents (we are using saffron or zafran in our phirni). Our version is made without any condensed milk or mawa because we found that they don’t make any noticeable difference to phirni. We also like our phirni to be creamy and plain, so we have left out any additional garnishes.</p>

<h2 id="Method"><a href="#Method" class="headerlink" title="Method"></a>Method</h2><ol>
<li>Wash the rice and soak it in water for 30 minutes. Be careful not to overwash or we’ll lose the starch, which we want to preserve for creaminess of the phirni. After 30 minutes of soaking, strain the rice over a colander and leave it to air-dry.</li>
<li>Soak the <em>bhnaar</em> in water for 30 minutes as well.</li>
<li>Once dry, transfer rice to a grinder and reduce it to a powder in 4 or 5 short pulses. The grind should neither be too coarse nor too fine. Take 1 cup of milk out of the total milk and mix the rice flour in it. Premixing rice flour with cold milk before adding it to hot milk will prevent clumping.</li>
<li>Gently toast some cardamom pods in a pan and crush them to a powder. Sift through a tea-strainer to ensure the powder is fine. We need ½ a tsp of cardamom powder; we got ours from 4 large pods of cardamom.</li>
<li>Heat milk in a heavy-bottomed pan and reduce it on medium heat for about 10 minutes. Then add the rice flour and cold milk mixture and stir immediately to prevent rice from clumping.</li>
<li>Add 4 or 5 strands of saffron OR 1 tsp of kewra water (whichever you are using) to the pan.</li>
<li>Continue reducing on low heat until phirni thickens. Keep stirring continuously, as that will help release starch and make the phirni creamy.</li>
<li>Once the rice is cooked, add sugar and a pinch of salt. Don’t skip the salt—it balances the sweetness and makes a big difference to the taste of phirni! Also add the cardamom powder now.</li>
<li>Keep cooking until the phirni reaches the right consistency. It should neither be too thick, nor too thin—when poured, it should just about find its own level.</li>
<li>Transfer to the <em>maati’r bhnaar</em> or any ceramic or glass bowl to set. Cover the bowls/dishes with a plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 24 hours to set completely. The plastic covering will prevent the phirni from absorbing any ‘funny fridge smells’. Enjoy chilled.</li>

<p class="post-intro">Fragrant rice and soft mutton get together in this classic Calcutta biryani dish. Contains potatoes!</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p>[<em>In this series, we tip our hats to some of our favourite dishes available in the restaurants, cafés, and cabins of Calcutta.

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>alcuttans are truly passionate about their mutton biryani. Kolkata has its distinct style of biryani which is on a par with the best biryanis in India—including Lucknow-style biryani and the Hyderabadi biryani. Kolkata biryani, in spite of the usage of a staggering number of spices, is not spicy. It is subtle and fragrant without being dry. A good Kolkata biryani should be moist and can be eaten on its own—no raita or salan required. This style of biryani is descended from the Lucknow style biryani that came to Calcutta with the exiled Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah (remember Satyajit Ray’s “Satranj Ke Khilari”?). </p>
<p>What started with just a handful of restaurants such as Royal India Hotel, Shiraz, and Aminia has become the most widely available and eaten street food in Calcutta. Many new restaurants have sprung up and the competition for excellent biryani in Calcutta is only getting tougher. Our recipe of the Kolkata mutton biryani isn’t perfect, but it is very, very close. With some practice, planning and patience this recipe will help you make a very good Calcutta-style biryani at home.</p>

<li>Spice grinder</li>
<li>Pressure cooker</li>
<li>Stove</li>
<li>Weighing scale</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Method"><a href="#Method" class="headerlink" title="Method"></a>Method</h2><p><strong>STEP I—FRYING POTATOES</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Peel potatoes and smear on them yellow food colour. Keep the potatoes whole (each piece should be about 80 g) and go easy on the amount of food colour.</li>
<li>Heat vegetable oil, 3 cm deep, in a pan. Fry the potatoes until they are lightly coloured on all sides (about 4 minutes).</li>
<li>Drain them from the oil and set aside. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>STEP II—MAKING BIRISTA</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In the same oil, add sliced onions, a small handful at a time, to make birista. Watch the full video on how to make birista.</li>
<li>Weigh two separate portions of birista—20 g and 15 g—and keep ready.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>STEP III—MAKING BIRYANI MASALA</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In a pan set over medium heat, add all the spices in the given proportions for ‘biryani masala’ (see above). Gently toast them, stirring continuously.</li>
<li>Transfer the toasted spices to a spice grinder and blitz them to a fine powder.</li>
<li>Weigh two separate portions of biryani masala—8 g and 5 g— and keep ready.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>STEP IV—MARINATING MUTTON</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Peel ginger and garlic, roughly chop them, and crush them into a fine paste.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl or pressure cooker, mix together yoghurt, ginger and garlic paste, birista, kewra water, biryani masala, red chilli powder, salt, and ground pepper, in the proportions given above for ‘marinating mutton’. </li>
<li>Add the mutton pieces and coat them well with the marinade, making sure to to massage it into the crevices too.</li>
<li>Cover and set aside for 1 hour.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>STEP V—SOAKING RICE</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Meanwhile, wash the rice and soak it in water for 30 minutes. At the end of this time, drain the water and strain the rice over a net or colander. Set aside. Soaking leads to longer and fluffier rice grains. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>STEP IV—COOKING MUTTON</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>After the mutton has had 1 hour to marinate, transfer it to a pressure cooker. </li>
<li>Lay the fried potatoes on top.</li>
<li>Add 150 g water and pressure cook it on medium-low heat for 30 minutes. Allow the steam to release naturally for another 15 minutes before opening the lid of the pressure cooker.</li>
<li><em>Separating mutton, potatoes, and <em>yakhni</em>:</em> Extract the potatoes and mutton pieces in separate dishes and set them aside. Now strain the liquid remaining in the pressure cooker. This is called ‘yakhni’ (a broth resulting from mutton and spices cooked together). We need just 200 g of it, so weigh it out and keep ready.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>STEP VII—BOILING WATER FOR RICE</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Place the spices mentioned in the ‘rice’ section above in the given proportions on a small square of cheesecloth. Tie them with a piece of twine to form a bag.</li>
<li>In a large pot, take 3 kg water. Add 30 g salt to it.</li>
<li>Add the bag of spices to the water and allow it to come to a boil (should take about 20 minutes). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>STEP VIII—PREPARING FOR ASSEMBLY</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Meanwhile, prepare for assembly by weighing out all that you will need (see ‘assembly’ section above) and keeping ready.</li>
<li>This is the order in which you will need everything.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Bay leaves</li>
<li>Cooked mutton pieces</li>
<li>Cooked potatoes</li>
<li>Alubukhara</li>
<li>Birista</li>
<li>Rose petals (if using)</li>
<li>Biryani masala</li>
<li>Grated khoya kheer</li>
<li>Yakhni</li>
<li>Lime juice</li>
<li>Saffron and yellow food colour mixed in 20 g warm milk</li>
<li>Rose water, kewra water, and meetha attar mixed in 180 g warm milk</li>
<li>Ghee and butter, melted together in the microwave</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>STEP IX—COOKING RICE, ASSEMBLY, AND DUM</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Set the <em>biryani’r hnari</em> or pan you are using for dum on low heat. Grease it with ghee.</li>
<li>Lay bay leaves in a single layer to cover the bottom of the pan. These will impart an aroma and provide buffer against burning.</li>
<li>Place the mutton pieces in a single layer, and the potatoes on top of the mutton. Don’t place potatoes too close to the edge or you might accidentally cut into them while serving. </li>
<li>Strew alubukhara, birista, and rose petals evenly.</li>
<li>Take half the stipulated amount of biryani masala and khoya kheer, and spread evenly. We will use the remaining half in the next layer. </li>
<li>Now add the yakhni and lime juice.</li>
<li>By this time the water for your rice should have come to a boil and its colour changed. Extract the bag of spices and discard it. Add the rice and let it cook until 80% done, that is, until when the centre is no longer hard, but the grain is still firm. Our rice took about 5 minutes to reach this stage, but read your packet instructions.</li>
<li>Strain rice, a ladle at a time, and spread it directly in the pan. Repeat this until half the rice is added to the pan.</li>
<li>On top of this first layer of rice, spread the remaining biryani masala and khoya kheer. Also spread the saffron+colour mixture evenly. </li>
<li>Now strain the rest of the rice and add it to the pan. Flatten it gently.</li>
<li>On top of the second layer of rice, add milk mixed with the aromatics. Also add melted butter and ghee, making sure to drizzle it near the sides of the pan too. </li>
<li>Cover the pan with heavy-duty aluminium foil (if yours is thin, use double layers), sealing the sides well so that no steam escapes. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. If you don’t want to use foil, you can also seal the lid with a wet flour dough.</li>
<li>Set the pan on dum on medium-low heat for 30 minutes. Turn of the heat and allow it to rest another 15 minutes before serving.</li>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>alk by any joint specialising in serving up Mughlai delicacies in Kolkata and its outskirts and you will most likely find a massive lagan of chaap being tended to right there on the footpath. Chaap is as ubiquitous in Kolkata’s Mughlai eateries, big and small, as biryani. Beef chaap is specially popular among aficionados. In this video, we show you how to recreate restaurant-style, tender, melt-in-your-mouth beef chaap, championed by joints such as Asma, Nafeel, Zam Zam, Afreen, Arafat, and their ilk, at home.</p>
<p>Chaap is basically a preparation where thin slices of meat are marinated, usually tenderised, and fried in oil at very low temperature over a long period of time. Bengali cuisines both sides of the border make varying kinds of dry and gravy-laden chaap preparations. The Kolkata chaap in particular has generous amounts of spicy gravy and is served with a drizzling of the oil it is cooked it. Enjoy it with naan, tandoori rooti, roomali rooti, porota, or a plate of warm aromatic biryani.</p>

<li>Soak poppy seeds, cashew nuts and charmagaz in water for at least 2 hours. Then, drain the water and make a paste, first of the poppy seeds, and then of cashew and charmagaz together. </li>
<li>Roughly chop onions, ginger, garlic, and green chillies, and make a paste of these too.</li>
<li>Transfer all the pasted ingredients to a large mixing bowl.</li>
<li>Mix in yoghurt, chhatu, shahi garam masala, kashmiri red chilli powder, turmeric, salt, kewra water, rose water, meetha attar, and saffron (mixed in 1 tbsp warm milk).</li>
<li>Grate khoya kheer and add it to the bowl too.</li>
<li>If your meat is particularly tough, you can add grated papaya to the mix. Papaya skin contains an enzyme called papain, which breaks down meat proteins and helps tenderise it.</li>
<li>Lay a beef slice between two sheets of plastic and use a mallet or pestle to gently flatten it. This will lead to tender chaap. However, be careful not to hammer too forcefully or the meat may fall apart. </li>
<li>Add the slices to the prepared mixture, making sure to coat each slice well on both sides. Leave them to marinate for 2 hours.</li>
<li>Heat a dalda, ghee, and vegetable oil in a large, flat, heavy-bottomed pan on low heat. We used these in the ratio 2:1:4. The fat should be 2cm deep. Don’t heat the oil up too much; chaap needs to be fried in oil at a very low temperature (150°C) for a long time.</li>
<li>Lower the marinated beef into the oil. Try and keep the meat as far away from the direct flame as possible. The best practice is to line the edge of the pan with the meat. </li>
<li>Fry for about an hour or until the meat is tender, turning over once in a while to cook it evenly from both sides.</li>
<li>Once the meat is soft enough that it breaks apart using just two fingers and the gravy has acquired a nutty brown colour, remove from the oil and serve.</li>

<p class="post-intro">A chilled sweet, savoury and sour watery chutney made from small green mangoes with an added kick of pungent mustard oil.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>am’er tok (pronounced “tawk”) is a recipe for the hot Bengal summers when the mangoes are not ripe yet, and frequent nor’westers or afternoon storms keep knocking unripe green mangoes off the trees. Bengalis love making all sorts of cooling green mango recipes in these months. Besides a variety of <em>tok dal</em>, <em>achaar</em> (pickles) and <em>chutney</em>, <em>aam’er tok</em> or <em>ambol</em> too is popular during summers. It is a unique transitional course just after the fish and meat course and before dessert. Sometimes, on very hot days <em>ambol</em> or <em>tok</em> can even play the role of dessert in ending the meal. </p>
<p>For this <em>aam’er tok</em> recipe remember to select the smaller, more fragrant unripe green mangoes. The large, nearly ripe green mangoes don’t have the same tartness, flavour or texture. This can be cooked very quickly and easily, and stored in the fridge for a few weeks. Serve chilled towards the end of the meal and experience the cool-sweet-savoury-sour <em>tok</em> make its way to your soul. </p>

<p class="post-intro">A 100 year old recipe from Rabindranath Tagore’s niece, Pragyasundari Debi’s cookbook <a href="&#39;https://www.amazon.in/dp/8172152175?tag=bongeats0c-21&#39;">Amish O Niramish Ahar Volume 1</a>.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>his recipe—bhaat’er kofta or deep-fried rice balls—is part of a series where we commemorate Rabindra Jayanti each year by cooking a recipe from a book written by members of the illustrious Tagore family. These bhaat’er koftas are from <em>Amish o Niramish Ahar</em> (Vol. 1), a well-known Bengali cookbook from the early twentieth century written by Pragyasundari Debi. She was Rabindranath Tagore’s niece who religiously tried out and recorded hundreds of recipes, both common and uncommon. </p>
<p>Fragrant, flavourful and creamy on the inside with a crunchy coating of yoghurt and semolina (<em>sooji</em>) on the outside, these koftas make a great tea-time snack. If they look uncannily similar to the Italian arancini, it is probably because they may be inspired by it. Give this recipe a go—it is quick and easy—and if you have tried any of the other recipes from <em>Amish o Niramish Ahar</em>, let us know in the comments section of our YouTube video. </p>

<li>Soak saffron in the milk and let it steep until the color enriches. Grind nutmeg, cardamom, cinnamon, and clove to a fine powder. In a little ghee, fry the raisins until they go puffy. </li>
<li>Now transfer the cooked gobindobhog rice to a mixing bowl. Add a chopped green chilli, salt, powdered spices, grated khoya kheer, and saffron-steeped milk. </li>
<li>Mix together thoroughly, mashing the rice as you go for a creamy texture. Once the rice looks well mixed, add the fried raisins and fold them in.</li>
<li>Divide the mixture in 30 g portions. Apply oil to your hands and roll each portion into a round kofta. </li>
<li>Make a paste of ginger and the remaining green chilli. Add it to the yoghurt and beat until you have a smooth mix. This should be thin (like beaten eggs!), so add water to the yoghurt mixture to adjust consistency. Also lay out the flour and semolina two separate flat dishes. </li>
<li>Bread each kofta by first dusting it in flour, then dipping it in the yoghurt, and finally coating it with semolina. </li>
<li>To deep-fry the koftas, heat oil in a kadai. You can also fry these in ghee. We usually flavour our oil with a tablespoon of ghee. Once hot, drop the koftas into the oil and fry on medium-high heat for about 3 minutes until they are lightly coloured. Serve piping hot.</li>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ocha’r ghonto is special to anyone who has grown up in Bengal. Mocha is the banana blossom. The niramish (vegetarian) mocha’r ghonto with narkel (coconut) and chhola (Bengal gram) is loved as much as mocha chingri garnished with small freshwater prawns. In this video, we show methods of preparing both mocha’r ghonto as well as mocha with chingri. This also includes a very easy, step-by-step guide to cleaning, preparing and cutting mocha. Like any Bengali niramish recipe, this one uses no onion or garlic—the main flavours come from ginger, cumin, ghee and garam masala. Mocha provides a crunchy texture that is a canvas for all these flavours. Give this Bengali recipe of mocha a try. It is not the best looking dish, but once you taste mocha, it will change your life.</p>

<li>Clean and cut mocha <a href="&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4Igr5VwEEQ&#39;">as shown in this video</a>. A 550 g whole mocha roughly yields 300 to 350 g edible mocha. </li>
<li>Add chopped mocha to a pressure cooker with 10 g salt, ½ tsp turmeric, and 650 g water. Pressure cook on medium heat for one whistle and then allow the steam to release naturally. </li>
<li>Open the pressure cooker and strain the mocha over a net or colander. Once cool to the touch (in about 30 minutes), gently mash the mocha to get a mix of mushy and crunchy textures.</li>
<li>Heat mustard oil in a pan. If using prawns, coat them in a pinch of salt and turmeric, and fry them on medium heat for about 45 seconds. Remove from the oil and set aside. </li>
<li>To the same oil, add a tempering of dried red chilli, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. Once crackling, add the cubed potatoes and fry until golden (about 4 minutes). </li>
<li>Add grated coconut and fry for a minute before adding a slurry of spices made by mixing ginger paste, cumin powder, ½ tsp turmeric powder, and red chilli powder with 50 g water. Sauté the spices until they release oil. This should take about 10 minutes or so. Whenever the pan becomes dry, add a splash of water and continue frying. </li>
<li>Add green chillies and soaked chhola (if using). Sauté for another 3 minutes before adding boiled mocha.</li>
<li>Add salt and sugar. Sauté mocha with the spices for about 6 minutes on low heat. If the mocha becomes too dry, you may also add 1 tbsp of milk. </li>
<li>Add the fried prawns and/or dal’er bora (whichever you are using) and cook for 2 minutes to allow the flavours to mingle. Finish with ghee and garam masala.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="post-byline">Green banana fritters in a spicy curry</p>

<p class="post-intro">Bengali special spicy green plantain fritters soaked in a warm gingery curry</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>mong the many kolagach (banana plant) products Bengalis have thought to turn into delectable food items, kachkola’r kofta (raw banana kofta) remains an eternal favourite. Kachkola’r kofta are delicately spiced, deep-fried raw banana fritters. Boiled kachkola are mashed with boiled potatoes, onion paste, ginger, green chillies, and a host of dry spices including bhaja masala, which gives the koftas their distinctive flavour. A little maida (all-purpose flour) binds everything together. This mixture is then portioned, shaped into discs, and dropped in hot oil. We like to fry our kachkola’r boras until they are dark brown in colour (as opposed to golden brown). This leads to richer, better tasting koftas, which also don’t break as easily once introduced to the curry. This brings us to the second part of the recipe—the kachkola jhol/dalna. This raw banana or plantain curry is hot, gingery, and slightly sweet. The addition of grated coconut gives the curry body in addition to a nice texture. As always we finish this particular dalna too with some ghee and Bengali garam masala. </p>
<p>The green banana koftas, once fried and completely cooled, freeze very well. We usually make a large batch and freeze half for up to 30 days. Be sure to store them in an airtight box or bag. The day before you want to make the curry, move them from the freezer to the fridge and let them defrost slowly. Oh, and do not discard the green banana peels while making kachkola recipe, as you could turn them into a delicious, fiery <a href="/recipe/kachkola-khosha-chochchori">khosha chachchari</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut kachkola into 5-cm cross-sections and boil in a pressure cooker with 8 g salt, ¼ tsp turmeric, and 450 g water. On medium heat, one whistle should do the trick. Turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally. However, do not let the kachkola sit in the water for too long or it will absorb water and become soggy. </li>
<li>Remove the kachkola peels and transfer the boiled bananas to a mixing bowl. Add the boiled potato (80 g) and mash the two together until lump free.</li>
<li>Now add onion paste, ginger paste, grated coconut, green chillies, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGmCPwauVBs" target="_blank" rel="external">bhaja masala</a>, salt, sugar, and maida. Mix everything until well combined.</li>
<li>Divide in 30 g portions and shape into discs. </li>
<li>Lower the koftas into hot (170°C) vegetable oil in a single layer. Fry them until they are dark brown in colour, turning them over often. This should take about 4 to 5 minutes. Drain from the oil and set aside.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>STEP I—MAKE THE DALNA</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into 3-cm cubes. Make a slurry of spices by mixing ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric, and kashmiri red chilli powder with 50 g water. Set aside.</li>
<li>Heat mustard oil in a pan. Temper it with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds.</li>
<li>Add the potatoes and fry them for about 4 minutes, stirring frequently, until they are golden.</li>
<li>Add the grated coconut and fry it for about a minute. Be careful not to let the coconut burn.</li>
<li>Now add the spice slurry prepared earlier and sauté it on medium heat. Whenever the mixture dries out, add a splash of hot water and continue frying. Add the salt and 2 slit green  green chillies, and after a couple of minutes add the sugar. Cover the pan and keep cooking the spices until oil separates and the potatoes are done (about 6 minutes).</li>
<li>Add 450 g hot water. This will form the curry. Once it comes to a boil, drop in the koftas. Simmer on low heat until the curry thickens. This should take about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Garnish with ghee, <a href="/recipe/bengali-garam-masala/">Bengali garam masala</a>, and two more slit green chillies. Rest it covered for 2 minutes before serving.</li>

<p class="post-intro">Inspired by Malay flavours, ‘malai’-kari is an iconic Bengali prawn recipe made using giant tiger or freshwater prawns and fresh, creamy coconut milk.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>hingri malaikari is an iconic Bengali prawn curry made by cooking large tiger prawns (bagda chingri) or giant freshwater prawns (golda chingri) in a super-subtle, super-creamy coconut-milk sauce. Don’t be fooled by the elegant appearance of this well-loved Bengali treat—chingri malaikari is looks deceptively complicated to cook, when in reality it is easier to make than even chicken or egg curry!</p>
<p>The name of this chingri macher recipe bears somewhat of a double meaning. ‘Malai’ meaning ‘cream’ recalls the coconut-milk base in which the prawns are cooked. However, this prawn recipe seems to have made its way into Bengali kitchens through contact with Malaysian traders; so ‘malaikari’ is actually ‘Malay’ curry, over time transliterated as ‘malai’ curry. </p>
<p>In this detailed video we show you how to prepare a gorgeous, creamy chingri malaikari, starting from a walkthrough of how you can clean and devein giant tiger (bagda) or freshwater (golda) prawns. With this step by step recipe video at your disposal, there is no reason why you should hop over to you nearest Bhojohori Manna to satiate your chingri malaikari cravings!</p>

<li>Shell and devein the prawns, leaving the flavourful head intact. You may remove the stomach of the prawn, located near its head. We are leaving the shells on, but you may peel them off if you like.</li>
<li>Coat prawns with 1 tsp salt and ½ tsp turmeric powder, and set aside.</li>
<li>In a grinder jar, add onions and blitz them to a fine paste. Also extract coconut milk, reserving the first-press (thick) and second-press (thinner) milk in separate jars, and keep it ready.</li>
<li>Heat vegetable oil in a pan. Once hot, lower the prawns one by one, and fry them in batches for about 45 seconds on each side. The longer you cook prawns the tougher they’ll become, so remove them from the heat immediately and set aside.</li>
<li>Now add ghee to the residual oil. Temper with dried red chillies, bay leaf, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon.</li>
<li>Add onion paste along with sugar, and fry for about 8 minutes until the onions are brown. </li>
<li>Add ginger paste and fry for another 3–4 minutes, after which add turmeric and kashmiri red chilli powder. Stir intermittently so that the spices don’t stick to the bottom of the pan. When they do, add a splash of the thin, second-press coconut milk to loosen the mixture up and help fry it. Also add three slit green chillies and salt now.</li>
<li>Once oil starts separating from the spices, beat the yoghurt until it is lump free and add it to the pan. Drop the heat and stir vigorously to prevent the yoghurt from splitting. Cook it for 3–4 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the second-press (thin) coconut milk and simmer for about 2 minutes before adding the first-press (thick) coconut milk. Once it comes to a boil, add the fried prawns.</li>
<li>Allow the prawns to bubble in the curry, covered, for no more than 5 minutes. </li>

<p class="post-intro">A bright yellow, sweet Bengali polao redolent with ghee, garnished with fried cashews and raisins.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>asanti polao or mishti polao is a sweet, ghee-laden rice dish made from fragrant gobindabhog or kalijeera rice, cashew nuts and raisins. This is the main rice dish of choice for any special occasion. Among the side dishes served with basanti pulao, kosha mangsho is the most popular. While there are many other kinds of polao made with different types of fruits, nuts, meat or fish, this one has become the most popular, featuring prominently on the menus of Bengali specialty restaurants such as Bhojohori Manna, Kewpie’s, etc.</p>
<p>Use aged, non-parboiled (<em>aatop</em>) gobindobhog rice for this dish. New rice breaks very easily and will lead to a mash instead of perfectly cooked individual grains. We fry the rice before boiling it to enhance its flavours and break down the starch (which prevents rice from turning sticky). Also be careful of the amount of water you add. For 500 g rice, we’re using 1050 g water. However, as quality of rice varies widely, it is best that you reserve some of the water (5–10%) and add only if necessary. </p>
<p>This polao tastes best the next day, so plan accordingly. Resting allows all the flavours to mingle nicely. It also ensures that all the moisture is absorbed by rice grains, leading to fluffier polao. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="post-byline">A mildly bitter vegetable appetiser</p>

<p class="post-intro">This is the most popular version of shukto, a complex, milky, bitter vegetable stew served served at the beginning of meal to open up the palate for the oncoming spicier courses.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he most popular kind of Bengali <a href="&#39;/tags/shukto/&#39;">shukto</a> is the mild, comforting stew packed with a variety of vegetables, most notably potatoes, sweet potatoes, bitter gourd (korola), green bananas (kachkola), raw papaya (pepe), brinjal, drumsticks (shojne), and flat beans (sheem). Even though this form of shukto has in recent times come to be associated with ‘traditional’ biyebaris and other nemontonno feasts, and is also quite sought after at restaurants such as Bhojohori Manna, this is only one of the many different kinds of shukto recipes that are part of the Bengali cuisine. </p>
<p>By definition, a shukto is a mild, sometimes bitter, milky curry that is eaten after shaak (greens) and before dal (lentils). As such, it is not the name of a single dish, as is commonly believed, but an entire category of curries (like dalna or ghonto) in its own right. <a href="&#39;/recipe/lau-shukto&#39;">Lau’er shukto</a> (made with bottle gourd), shosha’r shukto (cucumber), and dhula shaak’er shukto are some of the other kinds of shukto known today, albeit among few families. Within the structure of the Bengali meal, shukto is eaten right at the beginning. It is said to stimulate the appetite and prepare the palate for the oncoming spicier courses.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="post-byline">A mellow yet hot stew of <em>jhinge</em> or ridged-gourds</p>

<p class="post-intro">This unusual appetiser was my grandmother’s specialty. Here ridged-gourds are stewed in a mild sauce with coconut, green chillies and nigella seeds. This is very easy to make and is perfect for summers when you don’t feel like eating anything rich. This recipe can be made with a combination of pumpkin and <em>jhinge</em> as well.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>A <em>jhal</em> is a type of Bengali curry characterised by the sharpness of its flavours, unlike its close cousin, the jhol, which is usually more mellow. This recipe, kumro’r jhal, is defined by the heat and aroma that comes from freshly crushed green chillies and kaalo jeere (nigella seeds). In a way, the green chilli and kaalo jeere combination is a timeless one when it comes to Bengali cooking—these two work hand-in-hand to temper several classic dishes. In this recipe, these are not only used as phoron but they are also pasted and added to the curry itself. Apart from that, this unusual jhal recipe also makes use of coconut paste, some milk, and a pinch of flour, all of which render a light, yet creamy, gravy. This dish is extremely easy to make (it doesn’t require you to spend several minutes sauteing spices) and can be knocked out in under 30 minutes. </p>

<p class="post-intro">A fine example of no-waste cooking where green crunchy banana peels and pungent mustard create a classic Bengali chorchori</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">K</span>achkola Khosha Chochchori is a type of chochchori made from the chopped peels of kachkola (green bananas/plantains). Bengalis consume all parts of the banana plant in one form or the other and green banana recipes are some of the most loved. Bengal, having seen devastating famines as well as the horrors of Partition, has had to be frugal and resourceful when it comes to food. Once you taste this kachkola’r khosha chochchori you will wonder why anyone would consider throwing away the peels when making a kachkola recipe! It is that delicious. So next time you’re making green banana kofta (kachkola’r kofta) or kachkola’r torkari, remember to preserve the peels! We hope you give this easy green bananas recipe a try.</p>

<p class="post-intro">A classic Bengali “healthy” appetiser of mashed bitter gourd and potatoes drizzled with sinus clearing mustard oil</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">‘U</span>chhe Alu Bhaate’ literally means bitter gourd and potatoes in rice. ‘Bhaate’ is a type of frugal Bengali dishes where vegetables are boiled along with the day’s rice. Once cooked, the boiled vegetables are fished out, and then may be mashed, seasoned with salt and garnished with pungent mustard oil. A tiny helping of this is served just at the beginning of the meal with rice. Such foods open up the palette to other more extravagant dishes to come. Uchhe or bitter gourd is also eaten during the spring when winter turns to hot summer in Bengal, and various contagious diseases such as measles and pox become common. Bitters were believed to help protect the body against these diseases.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>eyaj diye mosur dal, or Bengali orange-lentil soup with a flavouring of onions and panch phoron (a Bengali five-spice mix), is probably not something you would make on a weekly basis, mainly because it is not as versatile and neutral as a regular Bengali mosur dal (you know, the one with a kaalo-jeere-green-chilli tempering?), but it provides a nice change of palate once in a while. Like most Bengali dal recipes, this one is easy and straightforward enough to take no more than 15 to 20 minutes of your time.</p>

<p class="post-intro">A special egg curry where the thick fluffy omelette soaks up the warm ginger-garlic gravy. One of our favourites!</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>melette’er jhol is a <a href="/recipe/dimer-dalna/">Bengali spicy egg curry</a> prepared with omelette instead of regular boiled, pan-fried eggs. Although Bengalis love their egg curry, the ‘mamlette’er jhol’ occupies a special place in their hearts. It is quick to make and requires ingredients that are usually on hand, or easy to acquire in a pinch. What makes the egg omelette curry special, though, is the promise of a warm plate of rice with a flavourful, spicy curry-soaked omelette and juicy potatoes. </p>
<p>This recipe shows you how to prepare extra-spongy, fluffy omelette. If you feel like taking your dim’er omelette’er jhol to the next level, you will not regret the extra effort in preparing these light, airy omelettes. But this recipe works just as well if you decide to make a regular, pan-fried omelette. Whether in a hurry, or just tired from a long, rough day, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a more soothing and well-rounded meal than ‘mamlette’er jhol’ and rice.</p>

<h2 id="Method"><a href="#Method" class="headerlink" title="Method"></a>Method</h2><p><strong>STEP I—THE OMELETTE</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>For a spongy omelette, separate the whites and yolks of the eggs. </li>
<li>To the yolks, add 40g sliced onions, 2 g finely chopped ginger, 3 chopped green chillies, and 2 g salt. Mix well.</li>
<li>Boil, peel and roughly mash 80 g potatoes, leaving some lumps.</li>
<li>Place a skillet on low heat and add 15 g mustard oil. Preheat the oven to 180°C</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs just until they turn airy and opaque. There is no need to whisk them till the soft-peak stage; we just need an increase in volume. </li>
<li>Now gently fold in the yolk mixture into the egg whites, deflating as few air bubbles as possible. </li>
<li>Pour the mixture into the skillet. Place mashed potatoes in little dollops all over the egg mixture. Place the skillet immediately in the preheated oven for about 20 to 25 minutes, just until the omelette firms up. Be careful not to overcook the eggs, which can turn the omelette dry.</li>
<li>Remove from the oven and cut into 6 to 8 section, depending on how large you want one portion to be.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>STEP I—THE CURRY</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Cut potatoes in 5-cm chunks and parboil them either in the microwave (covered with plastic wrap, for 3 minutes), or in a pot (about 15 minutes).</li>
<li>Heat 25 g mustard oil in a <em>kadai</em>. Once smoking gently, temper it with the dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds.</li>
<li>Add 200 g sliced onions along with the sugar. Fry on medium heat for about 8 minutes until the onions turn brown. The sugar will help the onions brown.</li>
<li>Add the ginger paste and 3 slit green chillies. Fry these for 2 minutes, before adding the garlic paste.</li>
<li>Add the tomatoes and sauté for 6 minutes until the tomatoes are soft. </li>
<li>Make a paste of all the dry spices (turmeric, cumin powder, coriander powder, and red chilli powder) by adding 100 g water. Add this paste to the pan along with 2 g salt, and sauté the spices until their raw smell goes away. This should take about 10 to 12 minutes. When the pan becomes dry, add a splash of water and continue frying. </li>
<li>Now add the parboiled potatoes, and let them cook with the spices on low heat for about 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
<li>Add 650 g hot water to the pan. Once it comes to a boil, lower the omelette, making sure all the pieces are submerged in curry. Add 2 more slit green chillies (for flavour), and bubble on medium heat until the curry thickens. </li>
<li>Sprinkle shahi garam masala, cover the pan, and turn off the heat. Rest for 5 minutes before serving. This curry tastes best on the same day.</li>
