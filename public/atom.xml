<li>Rinse the <em>chhola’r dal</em> well and soak it in water for at least 2 hours. After this time, strain the <em>dal</em> and transfer it to a boiling pot or pressure cooker. Add 700 g water, 6 g salt, and the bay leaves. Boil the <em>dal</em> until it is tender, but the grains are still whole. The texture of this dish will depend a whole lot on how well the <em>dal</em> is boiled. We want each grain of lentil to be perfectly cooked, but not turned to mush. On medium heat, our <em>chhola’r dal</em> cooks to the desired doneness in 2 whistles. The time may vary for you.</li>
<li>Before you begin cooking, make a spice slurry by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder and 50 g water. Also, slice the coconut and slit the green chillies. </li>
<li>Heat mustard oil in a pan (on medium heat) and once it starts to smoke lightly and changes colour to a pale yellow, add the thinly sliced coconut. Fry until the coconut turns golden brown. This should take about a minute. Remove from the oil and set aside. </li>
<li>Temper the same oil with the dried red chillies, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. Stir in the <em>hing</em>, allowing it to fry for about 10 seconds. </li>
<li>Add the spice slurry we made earlier to the pan. Fry on medium heat until the raw smell of the spices is gone. This should take about 6 minutes. Add the slit green chillies and raisins, and continue frying until you see oil leaving the sides of the spice mixture. </li>
<li>Now add the boiled <em>dal</em> along with the water to the pan. (If you feel there’s a lot of excess water with the <em>dal</em>, reserve some in a bowl.) </li>
<li>Add the remaining salt (12 g) and allow the <em>dal</em> to bubble until it thickens (about 6 to 8 minutes). Depending on how soft or hard your <em>dal</em> is, you may have to adjust the flame and water accordingly. For example, if your <em>dal</em> is still slightly hard, boil on low heat, adding water to maintain consistency, until it is cooked. If it is on the softer, mushier side (first of all, you need to make note of where you went wrong and try correcting the boiling time on your next attempt!), turn up the flame to thicken the dal quickly. </li>
<li>Pick out a softened green chilli from the <em>dal</em>, mash it with the back of a spoon and add it back to the dal. Add the sugar and bubble for about a minute before stirring in the <em>ghee</em>, <a href="/recipe/bengali-garam-masala"><em>Bengali garam masala</em></a>, and fried coconut. Allow the <em>dal</em> to rest, covered, for 2 minutes before serving.</li>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>rder a plate of momos anywhere in and around the Himalayan region, and in most cases it is sure to be accompanied with a bowl of hot momo soup. It is a clear broth, comforting—you can even call it fortifying—and always complimentary. The momo soup recipe is the result of trying to use up throwaway items such as animal or bird carcass and bones, vegetable shavings, and so on. </p>
<p>This is a momo soup recipe that can be customised for pork, beef, or chicken bones. Normally, you would serve pork soup with pork momos, beef soup with beef momos, and so on. Here, we show you how you can get a potent and flavourful soup, with tips that will help produce a clear, non-cloudy, broth.</p>
<p>This broth can also be used as stock in the base of other, more elaborate soups, gravies, curries, etc.</p>

<li>Transfer the bones to a boiling pot. Fill the pot with hot water and gently simmer for 10 minutes. This will dislodge any impurities present in the bones and they will float to the top.

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>his pork momo recipe is ideal for chilly winter evenings. Here, we show you how make momos—steamed dumplings that originated possibly in Tibet and are a staple in Nepal, Sikkim, Darjeeling and Bhutan. There is nothing quite like biting into juicy a momo that is bursting with the juices and fat from the meat and vegetables. A good pork momo is a joy to eat. </p>
<p>This recipe for the momo filling calls for some very simple ingredients, the most essential among which is fatty minced pork, containing at least 30 to 50 per cent fat. If you are shopping for pork in Calcutta, just ask for ‘momo pork keema’ at shops such as UP Cold Storage (New Market) or Chaman’s (Beckbagan), and the butchers will be able to give you a mince with the ideal fat to meat ratio! The pork shoulder and pork belly are good cuts for using in momos.</p>
<p>Serve it with a simple hot momo chutney and a bowl of momo soup.</p>

<li>Finely chop the onions, green onions, coriander, ginger, and green chillies. In a momo, since all the ingredients are steamed at the same time, cutting the vegetables finely ensures that they all cook together. Besides, you don’t want a large chunk of, say, onion in your momo, rather a little bit of everything in each bite. This step is the most important, so take you time with the chopping.</li>
<li>If using pork fat, hack it to a mince using your knife. If using butter, melt it in a microwave or over the stove.</li>
<li>To a mixing bowl, transfer the minced pork, chopped vegetables, and the fat/butter. To these, add the salt, pepper, MSG, and soy sauce.</li>
<li>Mix thoroughly until everything is well combined. Cover and set it in the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours, although it is best if you can do this overnight. This standing time will allow all the flavours to mingle together. Moreover, chilling the pork mix makes the job of filling the momos infinitely easier.</li>
<li>Now make the momo wrappers as shown in this video.</li>
<li>Divide the pork mix into 20 g portions. Place these back in the fridge to chill until you need them. We like to portion our filling on two separate plates, so that one can stay in the fridge until the one you’re currently using gets warm, in which case you can just switch out the plates. That way, you always have a batch of chilled pork.</li>
<li>Take a momo wrapper and place the pork mix at its centre. Apply water all around the edges of the wrapper and start pleating. Use your left hand to form the pleats and keep the filling inside, and right hand to pinch the pleats closed. If you’re just starting out, try resting the momos on the table for easier shaping. Beginners may also use a little less filling to practice with. For a demonstration, watch this video. Make sure that the momos are perfectly sealed and that there are no air pockets within. These might cause the momos to burst while steaming.</li>
<li>Grease the steaming dish with oil and arrange the momos on it. Don’t crowd the steamer. Place it over boiling water and steam for around 12 minutes (±2 minutes). You don’t want to overcook the momos, or they’ll become dry and chewy. </li>
<li>Transfer to a plate immediately and serve with hot <a href="/recipe/momo-soup/">soup</a> and <a href="/recipe/red-momo-chutney">chutney</a>. </li>

<p class="post-intro">The perfect, percise how-to video for momo or dumpling wrappers at home from scratch.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p>[<em>In this series, we tip our hats to some of our favourite dishes available in the restaurants, cafés, and cabins of Calcutta. Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city. Make these at home, or hunt them down from the source—irrespective of how you get your hands on these items, we hope you enjoy them.</em>]</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>aking momo wrappers from scratch is very easy, not least because the momo dough requires only four ingredients, including water! The trick is to make a stiff dough, knead it extremely well, and rest it in a plastic bag. The dough then becomes smooth and ready to be portioned and filled with a momo filling of your choice. In this recipe for the momo dough, we take you through the steps of kneading and rolling out the wrappers to the perfect diameter and thickness. Since the edges of a momo are crimped together, we need to ensure that the sides of the wrapper are thin so that they cook at the same time as the rest of the momo. The rolling method shown in this video is a traditional one, which ensures that your momo covering turns out soft and perfectly cooked no matter what you fill it with!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="post-byline">Fresh, Indian cottage cheese</p>

<p class="post-intro">Paneer might be widely popular all over India, but its close cousin <em>chhana</em> is the ultimate conqueror of the world of Bengali sweets.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>aneer is one of the most neutral ingredients in Indian cooking, which makes it ideal for use in a wide array of curries. A good paneer must be well formed and not crumbly. Its structure shouldn’t be too tight, otherwise it will become tough and not absorb any curry. </p>
<p>While paneer is especially adored among aficionados of some branches of north Indian cuisine in particular—it is the vegetarian’s delight—its close cousin <em>chhana</em> (or <em>chhena</em>) holds a special place in Bengali cooking. From being the base for all manner of Bengali sweets (<em>sondesh</em>, <em>roshogolla</em>, anyone?), it is also used to make <em>chhana’r torkari</em>, a curry with mildly spiced <em>chhana koftas</em>, which is a beloved delicacy.</p>

<li>In a saucepan, bring the milk to a boil. Turn off the heat and add vinegar/lime juice.</li>
<li>Stir until you notice the ‘curds’ separating from the ‘whey’ (a translucent liquid). </li>
<li>Place a strainer over your mixing bowl, and the cheesecloth over the strainer. Pour the contents of your saucepan over this contraption. By doing so you are collecting the curds in the cheesecloth and allowing the whey to drain into the bowl below. </li>
<li>Gather the edges of the cheesecloth and lift the paneer in a bundle. Using your palm, gently mould the sides and top of the sack so as to close any gaping holes or cracks.</li>
<li>Hang it over your sink and allow the remaining water in the paneer to drip naturally (for about 30 minutes). Do not squeeze or put any weight on it. Trying to force the water out or compress it too much will compact the paneer, closing all its pores and not allowing it to absorb the curry later on. </li>
<li>If you need <em>chhana</em>, you can now unwrap the bundle and proceed to crumble/mash it according to your recipe. But if you’re going for paneer, after 30 minutes of hanging, place the bundle in the refrigerator and chill it for at least an hour. This will harden the fat in the curds and allow for the cutting of sharp, clean cubes. It also helps to warm the blade of your knife in a glass of hot water. When cutting the paneer into cubes, slide your knife instead of pressing it down. This will give you perfect, clean cuts. Divide the paneer in cubes as specified by your recipe.</li>

<p class="post-intro">There are no special ingredients to making a good mutton <em>kosha</em>. All it takes is patience.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>utton <em>kosha</em> is an iconic Bengali delicacy. The word <em>kosha</em> is similar in meaning to <em>bhuna</em>, which involves slowly cooking a gravy over low flame for a very long time to get a rich, dark-brown gravy and melt-in-the-mouth mutton pieces. It is worth pointing out that in Bengal, as well as in India, mutton is commonly used to refer to goat’s meat. Mutton <em>kosha</em> (or <em>kosha mangsho</em>) can be served with <em>porota</em> or <em>polao</em>. It tastes great even with plain rice. One of the most famous shops selling this style of mutton <em>kosha</em> is Golbari at the Shyambazar crossing in Calcutta. While we are not certain that our version is exactly like Golbari’s, we can assure you it certainly tastes very good.</p>

<li>For the marinade, add 100 g quartered onions, 5 g roughly chopped garlic, 100 g yoghurt, 15 g salt, turmeric, and shahi garam masala to a grinder jar. Blitz to form a smooth paste. </li>
<li>Coat all the mutton pieces with the marinade, making sure to get into all the nooks and crannies of the meat. Cover and allow the mutton to marinate in the refrigerator for about 8 hours. </li>
<li>Coming to the prep: Cut 400 g onions into thin slices. For this recipe, sliced onions define the texture of the curry. Diced, chopped, or puréed onions won’t give you the same result. Using a mortar and pestle, crush together 10 g garlic and 20 g green chillies to a paste. For ease while stirring later on, you may also cut all the bay leaves in 3-cm sections using a pair of scissors.</li>
<li>Heat a large <em>kadai</em> and add mustard oil to it. Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, add the dried red chillies, bay leaves, cinnamon, green cardamom, black cardamom, and cloves. </li>
<li>Add the onions and fry them on medium flame for about 15 minutes until they are light brown in colour. Then, add the ginger paste, and garlic and green chilli paste, and fry for another 5 minutes. Keep the flame medium to low, depending on whether your onions are sticking to the pan or not, and stir often. We want to fry the spices as well as develop colour on the onions. Next, add the dry spices (coriander, cumin, and red chilli) mixed with 100 g of water. Continue frying the onions along with the spices for about 15 more minutes. By now (it’s been 30 minutes since we started), your onions should have taken on a reddish-brown colour and the spices started releasing their oils. </li>
<li>Add the marinated mutton to the pan. The mutton has been in the fridge, so it is cold. Raise the heat and mix everything thoroughly. Fry the mutton, stirring frequently to check that it’s not sticking to the pan, for 15 minutes on high heat. Beat 150–200 g yoghurt until it is lump-free and add it to the pan. Also add 8 g salt and 10 g sugar at this point. Mix everything and keep frying. Once the moisture (from the cold mutton and yoghurt) starts to dry out, drop the heat to medium.</li>
<li>There’s not much to it now. On medium heat, for the next 75 to 90 minutes,  repeat the following steps:<br>–Add a splash of <em>hot</em> water to the pan (~30 ml at a time)<br>–Stir it in<br>–Cover the pan and cook for a minute<br>–Uncover and stir everything thoroughly <br><br><em>What we’re doing here is a kind of controlled browning. Stir, scrape, and incorporate any of the browned bits that may have stuck to the bottom of the pan, as that is what will allow the mutton to develop a rich colour. However, be alert so that the gravy doesn’t burn and turn bitter. Keep adding water a little at a time and cooking the meat in the gravy.</em></li>
<li>Once you are happy with the colour, add as much water as you’d like for the gravy/curry. Also add about 4 slit green chillies for flavour. Cover and cook until the mutton is tender. You should be able to tear it apart with two fingers.</li>
<li>Turn off the heat and top off with a little bit of ghee. Cover and let it rest for about 2 minutes before serving.</li>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>aneer is a late entrant to the Bengali food scene; Bengal is more fond of its <em>chhana</em> (<em>chhena</em>). <em>Paneer’er dalna</em> (Bengali paneer curry with potatoes and peas) is infused with the flavours of ginger, cumin, garam masala and ghee. This recipe also uses capsicum, which imparts a lovely peppery aroma to the dish. Here, fresh cubes of homemade paneer are shallow-fried and then added to the curry and cooked until they are soft and juicy. This is a very quick paneer recipe, that is prepared using no onion or garlic and is served with rice and dal, or with a light vegetable polao or luchi.</p>

Wait until the oil heats up fully and then place the paneer cubes in it in a single layer. Ensuring that the pan and oil are both hot will prevent the paneer from sticking to the pan. After about 45 seconds, flip the cubes and fry their opposite surfaces until they are golden. Fry just two of the surfaces, as frying all round will make the paneer rubbery and won’t allow absorption of curry later on. Remove from the oil and set aside.</li>
<li>Peel and chop potatoes in 3-cm cubes. Cut the capsicum in 2-cm squares.</li>
<li>Heat 15 g mustard oil in a <em>kadai</em> until it starts smoking and changes colour to a pale yellow. Temper the oil with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds.</li>
<li>Once the whole spices start crackling, add the potatoes. Cover and fry them on medium heat until the turn slightly golden (about 4 minutes).</li>
<li>Meanwhile, make a paste with ginger, cumin powder, kashmiri red chilli powder, turmeric powder, and 100 g water. Add it to the pan and cook it along with the potatoes until the smell of raw spices is gone. This should take about 6 minutes. If you find that the spices have dried out, add a splash of hot water and continue frying.</li>
<li>Add capsicum and 3 slit green chillies. Cover and cook for about 3 minutes until the capsicum softens.</li>
<li>Whip the yoghurt until it is lump-free. <em>Lower</em> the heat and add it to the pan. Stir quickly prevent the yoghurt from splitting. Cook <em>uncovered</em> for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the blanched peas (if you’re using raw peas, add them along with the potatoes earlier on) and sugar, and cook for 2 more minutes. </li>
<li>Now add 250 g hot water to the pan. This will form the curry. Once it comes to a boil, drop the chunks of fried paneer in it. Bubble on medium heat for about 6 minutes until the curry thickens.</li>
<li>Garnish with <em>garam masala</em>, <em>ghee</em>, and a slit green chilli. Cover the pan and rest it for 2 minutes before serving.</li>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">G</span>hugni is one of the most beloved of Bengali snacks. It is a dish of curried whole-yellow peas or motor (matar) dal. A good ghugni is one in which the motor dal is well-cooked, but remains whole. The key is to not overboil the dal. The consistency also needs be just right—slurpy but never watery. With just about 180 kcal per serving, you’d be hard-pressed to find an evening snack more filling, healthy <em>and</em> delicious than this. </p>

<li>Rinse and soak the dal in water overnight (at least 12 hours). Drain it from the water and transfer it to a saucepan.</li>
<li>Add 800 g water, 10 g salt, and 20 g onions to the the saucepan. Cover and boil the dal on low heat. The dal should be soft but remain unbroken. So be sure to keep an eye on it so that it doesn’t disintegrate. Once done, strain the dal and reserve the water for later. </li>
<li>Cut potatoes into 1.5-cm cubes, onions and coconut into thin slices, and roughly chop the tomato. Also crush the garlic and green chillies into a paste using a mortar and pestle.</li>
<li>Set a pan on medium heat and add 15 g mustard oil with 5 g ghee. Once hot, add the coconut slices and fry them until they are golden-brown. Remove them from the oil and set aside. Temper the oil with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. </li>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">V</span>egetable <em>pulao</em>, often called ‘vegetable fried rice’, is an easy-to-cook, nutritious recipe. It is a common item on Bengali wedding menus and is often served with fish fry, mutton <em>kosha</em>, or fish <em>kaliya</em>. This fried rice can easily be modified to include seasonal vegetables aside from the peas, beans, and carrots we’ve used here. Long-grained, fragrant Basmati rice is ideal for this preparation. The mark of a good fried rice is long unbroken grains of rice and vibrant, crunchy veggies. In this recipe, we show you techniques to help the vegetable retain their colour and crunch as well as prevent the breakage of cooked rice while mixing. </p>

<li>Wash and boil the rice in a pot full of water until it is 90 per cent tender. Drain the water and spread the rice over a colander so that it doesn’t cook any further.</li>
<li>Dice the carrots in 1-cm cubes. Chop the beans on the bias (in 1-cm sections) for a nice trapezoid shape. Shell the peas. Slit the green chillies.</li>
<li>Freshly grind the peppercorns so that you have about ½ tsp pepper. Mix it with the garam masala powder, salt, and sugar. Combining the spices and seasoning before adding them to the rice will ensure even distribution.</li>
<li>Set a pan on medium heat and add vegetable oil and ghee to it. Once hot, temper the oil with the bay leaves, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and about five peppercorns.</li>
<li>Add the cashewnuts and fry them until they are lightly coloured. We don’t want them completely golden at this stage as they will fry throughout the cooking process.</li>
<li>Turn up the heat and add the carrots. Stir-fry them for 2 minutes before adding the beans. Fry the beans for 2 minutes and then add the peas and raisins. Keeping the heat high ensures that the veggies retain their vibrant colours and don’t lose crunch.</li>
<li>Turn off the heat and layer half the cooked rice over the vegetables. Sprinkle half the premixed seasoning. Top off with the remaining rice and seasoning. Also add the green chillies.</li>
<li>To mix the rice thoroughly while ensuring minimal breakage of the grains, use the fold and rotate motion as shown in the video. Do this until everything is well combined.  </li>
<li>Cover the pan and set it over the lowest heat setting for about 20 minutes and steam until the rice has cooked completely. Check once or twice to see that the rice isn’t sticking to the bottom of the pan. Rest for at least 10 minutes before serving.</li>

<p><span class="dropcap">K</span><em>amranga</em> or <em>elo-jhelo nimki</em> is a Bijoya staple in most Bengali households. It takes its whimsical name from its twisty-lacy structure. Also known as <em>kamranga nimki</em> after the shape of the fruit by the same name, this deep-fried shortcrust pastry is characterised by its elegant spindle shape. A perfect nimki is not chewy but crisp. It breaks with a satisfying snap. In this recipe, we show you how to achieve <em>nimki</em> of the desired shape, colour, texture, and of course, flavour.<br></p><p></p>

<li>Take flour, salt, sugar, baking soda, <em>jowan</em>, and <em>ghee</em> in a large bowl and mix together thoroughly. Like any shortcrust pastry, we need to distribute the fat (<em>ghee</em> in this case) well within the flour before we add the liquid. So, take your time and rub the flour between your fingers until it resembles bread crumbs in texture. </li>
<li>Now add water and lime juice, and bring everything together. For the <em>nimki</em> to be crisp and flaky we must ensure as little gluten-formation as possible. So, don’t overknead the dough.</li>
<li>Cover the dough and let it rest for about 30 minutes. After this time, divide it into little portions of 20 g each. Flatten by rolling it between your palms. Do this for all the dough balls and keep them covered so that they don’t dry out. </li>
<li>Roll each disc into a thin, round pastry with a diameter of 10 cm. </li>
<li>Using a knife, cut parallel lines inside the rolled circle, 7 mm apart, leaving the edges intact. WATCH the video for a clearer picture. Apply a little water on the two edges perpendicular to the direction of the cuts. Carefully lift the pastry and pleat the dampened edges. Pinch each side to secure all the pleats together. You should now have a spindle-shaped, lacy pastry. Repeat this for the remaining dough.</li>
<li>Heat oil (about 3 cm deep) in a frying pan to 150°C. The oil should not be too hot otherwise the pastry will remain chewy inside, whereas we want it to be crisp and have a nice snap. Lower the <em>nimkis</em> in the oil one by one. Do not overcrowd the pan. Turn over every 45 seconds and fry each batch for about 8 to 10 minutes until the <em>nimkis</em> take on a  rich, golden colour. Remove them from the oil and transfer to a basket or cooling rack.</li>
<li>Cool completely before storing them in an airtight jar, in which they should keep well for up to a month.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="post-byline">Calcutta’s most popular and iconic street food</p>

<p class="post-intro">Of all the rolls, wraps, and frankies we have had, nothing comes close to a Calcutta roll—neither in taste, nor in sound architecture.</p>

<p>[<em>In this series, we tip our hats to some of our favourite dishes available in the restaurants, cafés, and cabins of Calcutta. Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city. Make these at home, or hunt them down from the source—irrespective of how you get your hands on these items, we hope you enjoy them.</em>]</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he egg roll is certainly Calcutta’s most recognizable and popular street food. But what makes a good roll? It should be served hot. So the assembly process, once the <em>paratha</em> has been fried,  needs to be quick and efficient. The outer shell, the <em>paratha</em> itself, must be flaky yet soft. It should not be too chewy, that is to say, you should not have to tug at it with your teeth. Most importantly, the <em>paratha</em> should be fully cooked and crisp. The filling should be evenly distributed so you get a little of everything with each bite. Finally, the mark of an excellently wrapped roll is that you can eat it using just one hand. Simply bite into your roll and when you reach the paper, gently grip the roll with your teeth to slide it out as you go along. No overflowing filling, no leaking sauces. Everything is contained within a neat package that you can enjoy on the go.</p>

<li>For the outer <em>paratha</em>/wrap, add the flour, salt, sugar, and <em>dalda</em> to a mixing bowl. Combine the ingredients until the fat is well dispersed in the flour. Take your time and rub the flour between your fingers until it resembles breadcrumbs in texture. This will lead to a flakier crust.</li>
<li>Now add the warm water and knead the dough for about 5 minutes until it is soft and smooth. Coat it with oil, cover the bowl, and allow it to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, mix together finely sliced onions, chopped green chillies and the juice of half a lime. Pickling the onions in lime juice reduces their sharpness. If using cucumber, peel it and remove the central seeds. Then chop them into thin matchsticks. Create an assembly station where you gather all the items required for the filling. This will allow you to easily put together the roll once the <em>paratha</em> is off the stove.</li>
<li>Back to the dough: once it has rested, divide it in 130 g portions. For an extra-flaky exterior, we will roll the dough in the <em>lachcha paratha</em> style, incorporating layers of flour and oil. To do this, form a ball and roll it out to a disc about 12 cm large. Apply a thin layer of oil on the surface and sprinkle some dry flour. Make an incision on the disc along a radius and roll it in the shape of a cone [WATCH THE VIDEO]. Press down to flatten. Rest the dough for about 5 minutes to relax it again, after which roll it for a second time to disc 22 cm in diameter.</li>
<li>Beat an egg with a pinch of salt and keep at the ready.</li>
<li>Heat about 4 tsp oil (12 g) in a flat frying pan or skillet. Add the <em>paratha</em> and fry it on both sides until golden. Rotate the <em>paratha</em> continuously, flipping often, for a uniform crust. Pay special attention to the sides to ensure that they crisp too. Once the <em>paratha</em> is completely cooked, spread the beaten egg over it. Before it settles, turn over to fry the side with the egg. Transfer it to the assembly station, with the egg side facing up.</li>
<li>Sprinkle it with <em>chaat masala</em> and rocksalt. Add a row of the pickled onions a little off the centre of the <em>paratha</em>. Squeeze some lime juice over it. Top it with cucumber if you like. One of our favourite variations of the egg roll is the egg-potato roll. If we have it on hand, we like to add some leftover spicy <em>alu’r torkari</em> as well. Finish everything off with a few squirts of ketchup.</li>
<li>Form a tight roll, making sure the filling is all enclosed within the <em>paratha</em>. Wrap a paper around two-thirds of the roll and tuck any excess at the bottom.</li>

<p class="post-intro">If you are just getting into the wonderful world of <em>kabab</em>-making, these are the easiest ones to start with.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">S</span><em>hami kabab</em> is well loved not least because it is one of the easier <em>kababs</em> to make. While producing good <em>kababs</em> generally requires special grilling, charring or <em>tandoori</em> techniques, <em>shami kabab</em> can be easily prepared at home with no special equipment. Popular on the Indian subcontinent, this snack resembles a pan-fried, ground-meat patty. It is best made with a lean, boneless red meat of your choice (mutton, beef, lamb, etc.). It is important that the meat has a low fat but high muscle content. Fat within the meat tends to melt the kabab when it is fried, while we want it to hold itself together. More muscle and fibre, on the other hand, will ensure that the meat has some texture when it is ground, providing a satisfying resistance with each bite. The use of <em>chhola’r dal</em> (split Bengal gram) adds nuttiness. Besides that, the other flavours come from chopped mint leaves, green chillies, <em>garam masala</em>, and ghee. We use a beaten egg to bind everything together. Depending on the recipe, such kababs may sometimes be coated in eggs or bread crumbs before they are fried. We, however, fry them directly so that the meat itself forms a rich, brown, caramelised crust.  </p>

<li>Wash and soak <em>chhola’r dal</em> overnight. Drain the water in the morning.</li>
<li>In a boiling pot, add the boneless meat cut into 3-cm cubes, soaked <em>dal</em>, roughly chopped onions, ginger and garlic, bay leaves, dried red chillies, and salt. Add about 400 g water and set the pot to boil. For this dish, the meat needs to be absolutely tender, but remain dry. It’s best, therefore, to add water a little at a time and keep an eye on the pot so that the bottom doesn’t catch, and yet there’s no extra water. Once the meat has cooked (this should take about 60 to 90 minutes depending on the meat and your location), on high heat dry off any excess water. </li>
<li>Pick out the bay leaves from the pot and discard them.</li>
<li>Transfer the mixture to a grinder jar and grind it on the lowest setting until it is uniform. You may need to scrape the sides of your jar a couple of times. Remember that a good <em>shami kabab</em> has texture. Your grind should not be too smooth or pasty. Rather, the meat fibres should still be visible.</li>
<li>Transfer this ground mixture to a mixing bowl. Add chopped green chillies, chopped mint leaves, raisins, lime juice, <em>shahi garam masala</em> powder, ghee, and a beaten egg. Mix everything together thoroughly by hand.</li>
<li>Portion the mixture into balls weighing 60 g each. Apply some ghee on your palms so the mixture doesn’t stick to them and form discs 6 cm in diameter, making sure to patch up as many cracks as you can. This will prevent breakage while frying.</li>
<li>On medium flame, heat your flat frying pan or skillet. Once hot, add vegetable oil, about 1 cm deep. For a good crust, its level should reach half the height of the <em>kabab</em>. Once the oil is about 180°C, gently lower the <em>kababs</em> one by one. Do not crowd the pan; fry no more than 4 to 5 <em>kababs</em> at a time.</li>
<li>Fry each side for about 2 minutes until they are brown. Drain from the oil on to a perforated vessel to keep them crisp. </li>

From its onomatopoeic name that recalls the sound (‘<em>chur-mur</em>’) a crisp <em>papri</em> makes when crushed to its vibrant amalgamation of flavours and textures, there’s nothing about this dish that is not delightful.

<li>Soak the <em>chhola</em> and <em>motor dal</em> for about 12 hours. Wash them after that. Drain the <em>chhola</em> and set it aside. Boil the <em>motor dal</em> until it softens but remains whole (it should not disintegrate). Drain the <em>motor dal</em> and leave it to cool.</li>

<li>While the potatoes are boiling, add 75 g hot water to the tamarind and allow it to soak for 15 minutes. This will soften the tamarind and ensure easy extraction of the pulp. Work the tamarind between your fingers to separate the skin and seeds. Press to squeeze out all the juice and discard the seeds. You should be left with some smooth tamarind pulp.</li>

<p class="post-intro">What better way to enjoy the season’s freshest hilsa than in a simple, mild curry?</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">‘T</span>el jhol’ is the name given to a light Bengali curry, which is infused with flavours of <em>kaalo jeere</em>, green chillies, and sharp mustard oil. Because it is sparsely spiced, this style of curry doesn’t overpower the star ingredient—the fish—but lets it shine on its own. This recipe for <em>ilish machh’er tel jhol</em> uses only seven ingredients, including the fish. Needless to say, it is designed to bring out the flavours of the fresh <em>ilish</em> in all their glory. If you have under 30 minutes and a batch of fresh <em>ilish</em>, this should be your go-to curry</p>
<hr>
<p>Ilish or hilsa is, however, is facing extinction due to high demand and overfishing. While <a href="http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/iucn_hilsa_study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">policy initiatives</a> between India and Bangladesh <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/india-bangladesh-seek-to-save-the-delectable-hilsa-113062700390_1.html" target="_blank" rel="external">are underway</a> to tackle this alarming situation (hilsa conservation depends a great deal on water flow in the Padma-Meghna and Hooghly-Bhagirathi river systems), we can do our bit too. We can be mindful <em>not to buy any hilsa</em> that is under 500 g / 25 cm. Catching of hilsa before the spawning stage is detrimental to the progression of the next generation. It is equally important also to <em>not buy hilsa during the breeding season</em> (especially October to November, but even better, until March). In 2016, Bangaldesh was able to <a href="https://scroll.in/article/806667/how-king-hilsa-made-a-comeback" target="_blank" rel="external">increase its hilsa yield</a> by 50 per cent by putting measures in place to ban fishing in the breeding season. It also laid down and imposed specifications for net size to prevent the catching of juvenile hilsa. There is a need to create more consciousness about the importance of conserving a fish that is perhaps Bengal’s greatest cultural icon.</p>
<p><strong> How can you help? </strong></p>

<li>Marinate the fish with ¾ tsp salt and ¾ tsp turmeric powder, and set aside.</li>
<li>Cut the brinjal into 5-cm chunks and slit the green chillies.</li>
<li>Before you begin, also make a paste of 18 g salt, 6 g turmeric, and 50 g water. </li>
<li>Heat 35 g mustard oil in a pan till it starts to smoke lightly and changes colour to a pale yellow. Add the brinjal and fry them till they are golden. On medium heat, this should take about 4 minutes. Drain from the oil and set aside.</li>
<li>Now, lower the fish pieces into the oil one by one and fry them for a minute on each side. Delicately flavoured fish such as the <em>ilish</em> does not need heavy searing, so fry very lightly. Remove from the oil and set aside.</li>
<li>Temper the same oil with <em>kaalo jeere</em> and 3 green chillies. Add the salt and turmeric mixture we prepared earlier. Fry until the smell of raw turmeric is gone. This should take about 6 to 7 minutes.</li>
<li>Add 350 g hot water. This will form the curry. Once it has come to a full boil, add the fried brinjal and allow it to bubble in the curry for about 2 minutes. Then, gently lower the fried fish. Be careful while stirring at this point because the fish is fragile and might break. </li>
<li>Boil on medium heat for about 5 minutes, after which take 2 tablespoons of the curry into a small bowl along with a couple of the softened green chillies. Add ¼ tsp of <em>atta</em> to this and mix everything until uniform. Mash the green chillies to release heat and flavour. Add this mixture back to the pan. Drizzle with 5 g of raw mustard oil and bubble for about 2 more minutes before serving.</li>

<p><hr><br><strong>A note on the yeast:</strong> Yeast will need to be used depending on its type. Check the box/packaging to determine whether yours is an ‘instant’ yeast, ‘active dry’ yeast, or ‘fresh’ yeast. <strong>Instant yeast</strong> doesn’t need to be separately activated. It can be mixed directly into the flour and kneaded along with the other ingredients. <strong>Active dry yeast</strong> and <strong>fresh yeast</strong> need to be activated before they can be added to the flour. To do that, disperse the yeast in lukewarm water (in this case, about 145 g) along with the sugar (10 g). Cover and set aside for about 15 minutes, at the end of which, if your yeast is active, the mixture should take on a frothy appearance. Add this mixture to the flour and proceed as instructed. </p>

<p class="post-intro">This traditional Bhutanese dish is a favourite at Calcutta’s famous restaurant The Blue Poppy.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p>[<em>In this series, we tip our hats to some of our favourite dishes available in the restaurants, cafés, and cabins of Calcutta. Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city. Make these at home, or hunt them down from the source—irrespective of how you get your hands on these items, we hope you enjoy them.</em>]</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">E</span>ma datshi is the national dish of Bhutan, and rightly so. All across the country, residents and travellers alike can be seen eating this hearty concoction of cheese and chillies. Apart from Bhutan, this preparation is also consumed in several parts of Northeast India and Nepal. ‘Ema’ and ‘datshi’ literally stand for ‘chillies’ and ‘cheese’, and as such can be made using one or more varieties of either ingredient. ‘Datshi’ is also used to refer to any cheese-based soup (the version with potatoes, for example, is called ‘kewa datshi’ where ‘kewa’ means potatoes). </p>
<p>This dish can be prepared using an assortment of chilli peppers for flavour. We’ve used jalapeños, but look for slightly large chillies such as those commonly used for <em>achar</em> or pickles. We’ve combined them with green chillies, which provide the heat. As for cheese, any good, locally available melting cheese (such as that commonly found in New Market in Calcutta) will do. In a pinch, you can also use processed cheese. Avoid using a stringy cheese like mozzarella for this soup. </p>

<p class="post-intro">In this recipe, we take you through the process of mixing, stuffing, rolling, and frying the perfect ‘parathas’.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>lu porota or ‘alu paratha’ is wildly popular all over South Asia—no <em>dhaba</em> scene is complete without the sight of hot parathas with melting butter on top. Home kitchens have undoubtedly devised healthier ways of dishing out this family favourite. Not only are these <em>porotas</em> satisfyingly delicious when served piping hot right off the skillet, they also make for extraordinarily good packed meals. Ideal for school or work tiffin boxes or long train journeys, soft <em>alu porotas</em> need few accompaniments besides some chilled yoghurt and hot, tangy <em>achar</em>.</p>
<p>A good stuffed <em>porota</em> has a flaky exterior (you should be able to tear it with one hand) and a generous amount of well-spiced filling. Moreover, the filling should be evenly distributed within the <em>porota</em> so you get some with every bite. In this recipe, we take you step-by-step through the process of creating soft, well-balanced <em>porotas</em>.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="Method"><a href="#Method" class="headerlink" title="Method"></a>Method</h2><p><strong>STEP I—MIX THE DOUGH</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Add <em>atta</em>, salt, sugar, and oil to a mixing bowl. Mix to distribute the oil evenly among the other ingredients.</li>
<li>Add the water. Use hot water for soft <em>porotas</em>.</li>
<li>Knead the dough for about 5 minutes. It may seem tacky at the outset, but keep going. The dough should be soft and pliable so that it can hold a generous amount of filling.</li>
<li>Once the kneading is done, cover and rest the dough for about 30 minutes.   </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>STEP II—PREPARE THE FILLING</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Meanwhile, halve or quarter your potatoes (depending on their size) and steam them till they are tender. This should take about 20 minutes. Steaming ensures that the potatoes do not overcook or absorb any excess moisture from sitting in a pot of boiling water. The drier the filling, the easier it is to stuff the <em>porota</em> without any leakage.</li>
<li>Peel the potatoes and mash them while they are still hot to allow all the steam to escape. This will further ensure that the filling remains dry.</li>
<li>Finely chop the onions, ginger, garlic, and green chillies. Tear or roughly chop the curry or coriander leaves, whichever you are using.</li>
<li>Heat 7 g vegetable oil in a skillet. Add the onions and fry them for about 4 to 5 minutes till they turn brown. </li>
<li>Add the ginger and green chillies, and fry for another minute or so before adding the garlic and curry leaves/<em>kasuri methi</em>/coriander leaves. Do not cook the garlic too much; turn off the heat 30 seconds after adding it to the pan.</li>
<li>Transfer this mixture from the pan on to the mashed potatoes. Also add the salt, <em>chaat masala</em>, <em>bhaja masala</em>, and <em>jowan</em>.</li>
<li>Give everything a good mix until the filling is uniform. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>STEP III—STUFF, ROLL, FRY</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Divide the filling into four equal parts (each should weigh about 75 g). Give the dough a quick knead and divide it into four equal portions too (about 70 g each). Form each portion of the filling and dough into a neat ball and keep at the ready.</li>
<li>Using your hands, flatten a ball of dough until it has stretched to a diameter of 8 cm. Place a ball of the filling in the centre. </li>
<li>Bring the sides of the dough towards one another. The idea is to completely enclose the filling with the dough. Pinch the gathered sides to seal the package.</li>
<li>Coat the dough with some flour and place it on the workstation in front of you. Press down gently to flatten the dough and distribute the filling evenly within it.</li>
<li>Using a rolling pin, start rolling in two short, gentle strokes. Rotate 90 degrees between each set of strokes. Keep doing this until the <em>porota</em> is about 18 cm in diameter. Be sure to roll at the edges and not at the centre. This will ensure that the <em>porota</em> is of a uniform thickness throughout. </li>
<li>In a skillet set on medium heat, add 1 tbsp of oil. Once hot, lay the <em>porota</em> flat on it. Wait for a minute and apply 1 tsp of oil to the top. Flip the <em>porota</em>.</li>
<li>Keep flipping every minute until the <em>porota</em> is an even, golden colour on both sides. </li>
<li>Remove from the skillet and serve hot.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="post-byline">Hilsa in mustard sauce, steamed in a banana-leaf parcel</p>

<p class="post-intro">Eating the endangered hilsa responsibly is likely to ensure that we enjoy classics such as this for a long time to come.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><em>lish machh’er paturi</em> combines three of Bengal’s greatest loves—the hilsa fish, the banana plant, and mustard. Even though it looks very polished, it is a fairly easy recipe to execute. It requires few ingredients, no special technique, and very little time.</p>
<p>Ilish or hilsa is, however, is facing extinction due to high demand and overfishing. While policy initiatives between India and Bangladesh are underway to tackle this alarming situation (hilsa conservation depends a great deal on water flow in the Padma-Meghna and Hooghly-Bhagirathi river systems), we can do our bit too <a href="http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/iucn_hilsa_study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">[source]</a>.</p>
<p><strong> How can you help? </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t to buy any hilsa that is under 500 g / 25 cm. Catching of hilsa before the spawning stage is detrimental to the progression of the next generation. </li>
<li>It is equally important also to <em>not buy hilsa during the breeding season</em> (especially October to November, but even better, until March).</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2016, Bangaldesh was able to increase its hilsa yield by 50 per cent by putting measures in place to ban fishing in the breeding season. It also laid down and imposed specifications for net size to prevent the catching of juvenile hilsa. There is a need to create more consciousness about the importance of conserving a fish that is perhaps Bengal’s greatest cultural icon. </p>

<h2 id="Method"><a href="#Method" class="headerlink" title="Method"></a>Method</h2><ol>
<li>Soak mustard seeds overnight in water.</li>
<li>Clean the <em>ilish machh</em> and cut it in 3-cm thick slices. <em>Kolapaturi</em> is best made with thick slices of fish. Set these pieces aside, preferably on a flat plate.</li>
<li>Drain the mustard seeds of the water they’ve been soaking in and add them to a grinder jar. Add 4 green chillies, roughly chopped, along with 100g water. Grinding green chillies with the mustard ensures that it doesn’t turn bitter. </li>
<li>Grind these to a fine paste. Take your time with this process. Scrape down the sides of the jar and grind as many times as it takes to form the smoothest possible paste. The finer the grind, the better the flavours.</li>
<li>Now, add the peeled and chopped coconut to the grinder jar, along with salt, sugar, and turmeric powder. Grind once again till everything is smooth and well combined. </li>
<li>Transfer this paste to a mixing bowl. Add the beaten yoghurt and mustard oil. Mix till the oil is fully incorporated. </li>
<li>Spoon this mixture over the <em>ilish machh</em>, dividing it equally. Turn the fish over and coat the other side as well. Use your hands to make sure every part of the fish, including its cavities, are well coated. Set it aside to marinate for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, wash and cut up some <em>kolapata</em> into rectangular sheets, 20 cm by 50 cm in dimension. Gently toast them on a pan set on medium heat. This will increase malleability of the banana leaves, ensuring that they don’t crack when folded. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
<li>Take a banana-leaf sheet in front of you. Spoon some mustard paste in the centre of one of the sheet. Set one piece of the fish on it. Top off with some more of the paste and a split green chilli.</li>
<li>Carefully wrap the fish with the banana leaf making sure that it is fully covered. If you find that your leaf is torn, wrap another layer of leaf around it. Tie this parcel up securely with a cotton string (don’t use synthetic or it will melt when heated). </li>
<li>Add a tablespoon of oil to the <em>tawa</em> (pan). Once hot, place the parcels on it side by side. </li>
<li>Cover and steam the banana-leaf parcels on low heat for 5 minutes on each side.</li>
<li>Unwrap and serve hot.</li>
