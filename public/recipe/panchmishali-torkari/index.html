<p class="post-intro"><em>Panchmishali torkari</em> is any Bengali mixed-vegetable preparation, in which the vegetables are first stir-fried and then steamed in their own juices till they are tender and well-integrated.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>s you might have guessed, the stars of this dish are the veggies themselves. This is not a preparation in which you spice up things with ginger or cumin powder or red chilli powder. The only spice this recipe calls for is a touch of turmeric. Mostly, it relies on the salt and sugar to help draw out the moisture from the vegetables, and allow their flavours to mingle while cooked together. We don’t add water to form a gravy. Rather we cook this <em>torkari</em> on low heat, with the lid on, for nearly 30 to 40 minutes. At the end of this slow cooking process, it reaches a state where no vegetable stands out, yet each has still held on to its flavours and integrity.</p>
<p>Coming to the selection of the veggies themselves, some type of starchy item such as a potato or sweet potato is used. These, being otherwise neutral in taste, are the perfect receptacle of the juices from the other vegetables. The mushy texture is usually contributed by pumpkin, while radish is used for the more sharper notes. Some kind of beans (such as <em>borboti</em> or <em>sheem</em>) add crunch and colour. In the winter months, cauliflower lends the most sublime flavour to the <em>torkari</em>, in addition to providing texture. Finally, slimier vegetables such as brinjals, or cabbage or leafy greens that are prone to wilting on application of heat and salt, coat the mix with their juices and hold everything together.</p>
<p>There are several versions of <em>panchmishali torkari</em>. The choice of <em>phoron</em> (or tempering) will depend on the vegetables used. In this particular recipe, we are using potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, cauliflower, <em>borboti</em> (yardlong beans), cabbage, and brinjal, with a tempering of <em>panch phoron</em>.<br></p><p></p>
