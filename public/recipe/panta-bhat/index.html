<p class="post-intro">Enjoy this centuries-old recipe with some of our exciting serving suggestions.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>engal, even today, is largely agrarian. It shares many of the characteristics of other eastern societies that developed around wet rice cultivation—a method that dates back to the Neolithic ages. India is the largest cultivator of paddy in the world, and West Bengal grows most of it. Bangladesh is the fourth largest producer of rice with 75 per cent of its arable land used for paddy cultivation. Suffice to say that rice—not just its consumption, but also its production—defines the Bengali culture more than we realise ourselves.</p>
<p>In this tropical land, summers are harsh. Farmers, labourers, artisans, who go out to work in the the fields carry with them a tiffin box of rice soaked in water, some salt, some green chillies, and a wedge of onion. This rice ferments to form <em>panta bhaat</em>. Sometimes, water is added to the cooked rice at night and had for breakfast. <em>Panta bhaat</em> originated as, and still is, means of sustenance for the poor. Different parts of eastern India have different names for this recipe—in Orissa they call it <em>pakhala</em>, and in Assam <em>poita bhaat</em>.</p>
<p>The fermentation of the rice carbohydrates by good bacteria increases the availability of a lot of micronutrients and minerals in the rice. The table below shows a comparison of available nutrition of 100 grams of cooked rice and <em>panta bhaat</em>:</p>

<p>Consumed in summer, <em>panta bhaat</em> supplies probiotic bacteria and plenty of micronutrients that aid digestion. It produces a soporific effect that is conducive to a siesta that Bengalis love.</p>
<p>In spite of its humble origin, <em>panta bhaat</em> is loved and enjoyed by many people, rich and poor. There is no real recipe for <em>panta bhaat</em>. So, these are our serving suggestions based on what our family commonly eats with <em>panta</em>.</p>
