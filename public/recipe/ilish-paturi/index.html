<p class="post-intro">Eating the endangered hilsa responsibly is likely to ensure that we enjoy classics such as this for a long time to come.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><em>lish machh’er paturi</em> combines three of Bengal’s greatest loves—the hilsa fish, the banana plant, and mustard. Even though it looks very polished, it is a fairly easy recipe to execute. It requires few ingredients, no special technique, and very little time.</p>
<p>Ilish or hilsa is, however, is facing extinction due to high demand and overfishing. While policy initiatives between India and Bangladesh are underway to tackle this alarming situation (hilsa conservation depends a great deal on water flow in the Padma-Meghna and Hooghly-Bhagirathi river systems), we can do our bit too <a href="http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/iucn_hilsa_study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">[source]</a>.</p>
<p><strong> How can you help? </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t to buy any hilsa that is under 500 g / 25 cm. Catching of hilsa before the spawning stage is detrimental to the progression of the next generation. </li>
<li>It is equally important also to <em>not buy hilsa during the breeding season</em> (especially October to November, but even better, until March).</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2016, Bangaldesh was able to increase its hilsa yield by 50 per cent by putting measures in place to ban fishing in the breeding season. It also laid down and imposed specifications for net size to prevent the catching of juvenile hilsa. There is a need to create more consciousness about the importance of conserving a fish that is perhaps Bengal’s greatest cultural icon. </p>
