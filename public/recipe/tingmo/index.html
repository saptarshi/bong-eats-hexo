<p class="post-intro">Another Blue Poppy favourite, this soft, airy breadroll goes extremely well with <em>datshis</em>, pork shapta, or chilli pork.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p>[<em>In this series, we tip our hats to some of our favourite dishes available in the restaurants, cafés, and cabins of Calcutta. Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city. Make these at home, or hunt them down from the source—irrespective of how you get your hands on these items, we hope you enjoy them.</em>]</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>ingmo or ting momo is one of those breads that is extremely satisfying to get right. The distinguishing feature of this steamed dumpling is its layered appearance. Once properly proofed and steamed, all the layers of the bun seem to open up like a flower. In this recipe, we show you how to knead, roll, and shape the dough in order to get a perfect tingmo. </p>
<p><hr><br><strong>A note on the yeast:</strong> Yeast will need to be used depending on its type. Check the box/packaging to determine whether yours is an ‘instant’ yeast, ‘active dry’ yeast, or ‘fresh’ yeast. <strong>Instant yeast</strong> doesn’t need to be separately activated. It can be mixed directly into the flour and kneaded along with the other ingredients. <strong>Active dry yeast</strong> and <strong>fresh yeast</strong> need to be activated before they can be added to the flour. To do that, disperse the yeast in lukewarm water (in this case, about 145 g) along with the sugar (10 g). Cover and set aside for about 15 minutes, at the end of which, if your yeast is active, the mixture should take on a frothy appearance. Add this mixture to the flour and proceed as instructed. </p>
