Add _atta_, salt, sugar, and oil to a mixing bowl. Mix to distribute the oil evenly among the other ingredients.\n2. Add the water. Use hot water for soft _porotas_.\n3. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes. It may seem tacky at the outset, but keep going. The dough should be soft and pliable so that it can hold a generous amount of filling.\n4. Once the kneading is done, cover and rest the dough for about 30 minutes.   \n\n**STEP II—PREPARE THE FILLING**\n1. Meanwhile, halve or quarter your potatoes (depending on their size) and steam them till they are tender. This should take about 20 minutes. Steaming ensures that the potatoes do not overcook or absorb any excess moisture from sitting in a pot of boiling water. The drier the filling, the easier it is to stuff the _porota_ without any leakage.\n2. Peel the potatoes and mash them while they are still hot to allow all the steam to escape. This will further ensure that the filling remains dry.\n3. Finely chop the onions, ginger, garlic, and green chillies. Tear or roughly chop the curry or coriander leaves, whichever you are using.\n4. Heat 7 g vegetable oil in a skillet. Add the onions and fry them for about 4 to 5 minutes till they turn brown. \n5. Add the ginger and green chillies, and fry for another minute or so before adding the garlic and curry leaves/_kasuri methi_/coriander leaves. Do not cook the garlic too much; turn off the heat 30 seconds after adding it to the pan.\n6. Transfer this mixture from the pan on to the mashed potatoes. Also add the salt, _chaat masala_, _bhaja masala_, and _jowan_.\n7. Give everything a good mix until the filling is uniform. \n\n**STEP III—STUFF, ROLL, FRY**\n1. Divide the filling into four equal parts (each should weigh about 75 g). Give the dough a quick knead and divide it into four equal portions too (about 70 g each). Form each portion of the filling and dough into a neat ball and keep at the ready.\n2. Using your hands, flatten a ball of dough until it has stretched to a diameter of 8 cm. Place a ball of the filling in the centre. \n3. Bring the sides of the dough towards one another. The idea is to completely enclose the filling with the dough. Pinch the gathered sides to seal the package.\n4. Coat the dough with some flour and place it on the workstation in front of you. Press down gently to flatten the dough and distribute the filling evenly within it.\n5. Using a rolling pin, start rolling in two short, gentle strokes. Rotate 90 degrees between each set of strokes. Keep doing this until the _porota_ is about 18 cm in diameter. Be sure to roll at the edges and not at the centre. This will ensure that the _porota_ is of a uniform thickness throughout. \n6. In a skillet set on medium heat, add 1 tbsp of oil. Once hot, lay the _porota_ flat on it. Wait for a minute and apply 1 tsp of oil to the top. Flip the _porota_.\n7. Keep flipping every minute until the _porota_ is an even, golden colour on both sides. \n8. Remove from the skillet and serve hot.\n\n\n\n## Served with\n- Yoghurt\n- Pickles\n- Green chilli\n- Raw onion","source":"_posts/aloo-paratha.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Aloo Paratha\ntags:\n  - snack\n  - vegetarian\n  - vegan\n  - paratha\ndescription: >-\n  Alu porota or ‘paratha’ needs no introduction.

Cut the cabbage into the thinnest possible shreds that you can manage. To make this process easier, deal with the vegetable in sections of 5 cm each. Take a segment, one at a time, and shave off shreds along its cross-section with your knife. Take your time with the cutting, because the outcome of the dish will depend on this step. [Watch this video, which shows you how to cut cabbage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3EUuW5S7s) for _badhakopi'r ghonto_.\n\n**PART II—TEMPERING THE OIL (_PHORON_)**\n2. Heat 15 g mustard oil in a pan till it begins to smoke.\n3. Add the _phoron_ (comprising the dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and cumin seeds) to the oil.\n4. Once the spices start crackling, add in the cubed potatoes.\n5. Fry the potatoes for 3 minutes on low heat, with the lid on.\n\n**PART III—SAUTEEING THE SPICES**\n6. Make a paste by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and 80 g of water.\n7. Add this mixture to the potatoes and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n8. Add in the diced tomatoes and shelled peas.\n9. Then, add another 80 g of water and sautee the spices till the water dries off.\n10. Add a slit green chilli and cook with the lid on for another minute.\n\n**PART IV—STEAMING THE CABBAGE**\n11. Add the shredded cabbage to the pan, along with the salt.\n12. Fold in the spices and cook on low heat with the lid on. The salt will start dehydrating the cabbage and drawing out its moisture.\n13. Steam the cabbage on low heat, with the lid on, for 12 minutes, stirring intermittently. Keep an eye on the pan to ensure that the cabbage doesn’t stick to the bottom.\n14. Add the sugar and cook for another 15 minutes, stirring intermittently. The sugar will soon start to caramelise. Be sure to scrape down and integrate the lightly browned bits of the _torkari_ that stick to the bottom of your pan (they are yummy!).\n15. This step is optional. You can coat a couple of cleaned prawns in a pinch of salt and turmeric powder, and fry in a separate pan for 30 seconds on each side. Chop the fried prawns in chunks of 1 cm, and add to the _ghonto_.\n16. Garnish with _ghee_, powdered _garam masala_, and a  slit green chilli.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | roti\n","source":"_posts/badhakopir-ghonto.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Badhakopi’r Ghonto | Dry Cabbage and Peas Curry\ndescription: A mildly spiced dry cabbage curry with peas-a kind of Bengali vegetarian ghonto with delicate flavours of ginger, garam masala and ghee.\ntags:\n  - ghonto\n  - torkari\n  - vegetarian\n  - vegan\n  - gluten-free\n  - cabbage\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1479339208/badhakopir-ghonto_thumbnail_c7ocub.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: nmkY-fGFTuY\ndate: 2016-12-01 20:30:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Badhakopi'r ghonto\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1479339208/badhakopir-ghonto_cover-small_uif59l.jpg\",\"description\":\"This is a beautifully spiced cabbage and peas preparation that is hot, sweet, and with hints of ginger, ghee, and garam masala.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT10M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT45M\",\"recipeYield\":\"4\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"Mustard oil (for cooking) 15 g\",\"Dried red chillies 1 piece\",\"Bay leaves 1 piece\",\"Cardamom 1 piece\",\"Cloves 1 piece\",\"Cinnamon 1 piece\",\"Cumin seeds 2 g (or ¼ tsp)\",\"Cabbage 400 g\",\"Potatoes 100 g\",\"Peas 50 g\",\"Tomatoes 30 g\",\"Prawns (optional) 75 g\",\"Ginger paste 20 g\",\"Cumin powder 2 g\",\"Coriander powder 1 g\",\"Turmeric powder 3 g\",\"Red chilli powder 1 g\",\"Salt 10 g\",\"Sugar 25 g\",\"Ghee 4 g\",\"Garam masala ¼ tsp\",\"Green chillies 2 g (or 2 pieces)\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1 Cut the cabbage into the thinnest possible shreds that you can manage.

Cut the cabbage into the thinnest possible shreds that you can manage. To make this process easier, deal with the vegetable in sections of 5 cm each. Take a segment, one at a time, and shave off shreds along its cross-section with your knife. Take your time with the cutting, because the outcome of the dish will depend on this step. [Watch this video, which shows you how to cut cabbage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3EUuW5S7s) for _badhakopi'r ghonto_.\n\n**PART II—TEMPERING THE OIL (_PHORON_)**\n2. Heat 15 g mustard oil in a pan till it begins to smoke.\n3. Add the _phoron_ (comprising the dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and cumin seeds) to the oil.\n4. Once the spices start crackling, add in the cubed potatoes.\n5. Fry the potatoes for 3 minutes on low heat, with the lid on.\n\n**PART III—SAUTEEING THE SPICES**\n6. Make a paste by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and 80 g of water.\n7. Add this mixture to the potatoes and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n8. Add in the diced tomatoes and shelled peas.\n9. Then, add another 80 g of water and sautee the spices till the water dries off.\n10. Add a slit green chilli and cook with the lid on for another minute.\n\n**PART IV—STEAMING THE CABBAGE**\n11. Add the shredded cabbage to the pan, along with the salt.\n12. Fold in the spices and cook on low heat with the lid on. The salt will start dehydrating the cabbage and drawing out its moisture.\n13. Steam the cabbage on low heat, with the lid on, for 12 minutes, stirring intermittently. Keep an eye on the pan to ensure that the cabbage doesn’t stick to the bottom.\n14. Add the sugar and cook for another 15 minutes, stirring intermittently. The sugar will soon start to caramelise. Be sure to scrape down and integrate the lightly browned bits of the _torkari_ that stick to the bottom of your pan (they are yummy!).\n15. This step is optional. You can coat a couple of cleaned prawns in a pinch of salt and turmeric powder, and fry in a separate pan for 30 seconds on each side. Chop the fried prawns in chunks of 1 cm, and add to the _ghonto_.\n16. Garnish with _ghee_, powdered _garam masala_, and a  slit green chilli.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | roti\n","slug":"badhakopir-ghonto","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-30T02:30:24.573Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjcles71400080wvh4ns65hg4","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A dry curry of cabbage</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">This is a beautifully spiced cabbage-and-peas preparation that is a little hot, a little sweet, and with hints of ginger, <em>ghee</em>, and <em>garam masala</em>.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">B</span><em>adhakopi’r ghonto</em> is essentially prepared by steaming fine shreds of cabbage (about 2 mm wide) in their own moisture, which is drawn out with the help of salt.

Suffice it to say that it is probably unlike anything you’ve ever tasted, especially if seasoned with the right amount of salt and sugar. And we won’t even go into how drop-dead gorgeous the finished product is. The recipe is ridiculously simple. You smear thickly sliced brinjals in turmeric and seasoning, and fry them on medium heat in a skillet. The sugar in the marinade allows the brinjals to develop a wonderfully amber-coloured crust, and deepens the flavour of the dish. If you have 20 minutes to spare, give this recipe a try. Eat it along with steaming rice and dal, and you will not regret it.</p>\n<p>This recipe uses one large brinjal. When shopping for the vegetable, be sure to select a specimen of the male variety as it is likely to contain far fewer seeds than its female counterpart. You can identify the type of the brinjal by looking at the indentation on its bottom. If the indentation is elongated and deep, it’s a female brinjal. And if it is round and shallow, that’s the seedless, male brinjal.</p></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 20 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 6 slices of <em>begun bhaja</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1 piece</td>\n<td>Large brinjal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Turmeric powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>a pinch</td>\n<td>Red chilli powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¾ tsp</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1½ tsp</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¾ tsp</td>\n<td>Flour (atta)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>~80 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil (for frying)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Mixing bowl</li>\n<li>Frying pan | skillet</li>\n<li>Long spatula | <em>khunti</em> | fork</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Wash the brinjal and chop off its stalk.

Families celebrating Christmas in Kolkata soak their dried fruits weeks in advance and book their slots with their local bakers for community baking of their cakes. Making a Christmas fruitcake at home is easy, to say nothing of rewarding.  Such fruitcakes contain their characteristic booze-soaked fruits and nuts, which can be customised in dozens of ways. In this recipe, we show you how to bake an indulgent Christmas fruitcake at home.\n</p>\n\n## About the tin\nWe like our Christmas cake as a good-sized loaf. A 9 × 4 inch (25 × 11 cm) rectangular loaf tin perfectly holds our batter for a 4-pound cake. This is a deep tin, which produces a hefty fruitcake that can be portioned into slices. However, since such a tin is so deep and narrow, we’ve taken some special precautions to ensure that the cake (a) rises evenly, (b) doesn’t crack or dome on the top, (c) cooks to a rich brown colour right up to the centre, without (d) the sides drying out during its long stint in the oven.\n\n### Preparing the tin\n* Butter the inside of the tin, making sure to get into all the corners. \n* Line the tin with two sheets of baking paper [as shown in the video](https://youtu.be/Cd0x661PujE?t=2m43s), leaving about 5 cm excess overhanging paper on both sides for easier cae removal later on.\n* Optionally, **wrap a cake strip** to the outside of the tin for added protection. You can easily make a cake strip at home as follows:\n* Measure the circumference and height of your tin. \n* Cut a sheet of newspaper about 4–5 times as wide as the height of your tin and long enough to wrap around it.\n* Keep folding the newspaper into a strip as wide as the height of the tin.\n* Wet this strip with water, squeezing out any excess.\n* Cover the whole strip in aluminium foil.\n* Wrap it around the tin and secure it with a piece of wet cotton twine.\n\n## The oven\nThis cake bakes at a low temperature of 150°C. In a deep and narrow loaf tin like the one we’re using here, it takes around 3.5 hours. If you try to bake this cake faster by raising the temperature, the outside will brown while the inside remains pale and undercooked. Having said that, keep in mind that every oven is different. Be sure to check on your cake after the first 2 hours in the oven. \n\n\n***\n**COOKING TIME** 4 hours (including 3 hours of oven time)\n**YIELDS** 4-pound cake (serves 20–25 people)\n**CALORIES** 316 kcal per serving\n\n***\n\n## Ingredients\n|               Quantity | Ingredient                                   |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **SOAKING THE FRUITS** |                                              |\n|                  100 g | Raisins                                      |\n|                  150 g | Pitted dates                                 |\n|                  100 g | Dried apricots                               |\n|                  100 g | Tutti frutti                                 |\n|                  100 g | Crystallised ginger                          |\n|                  125 g | Orange/mixed peels                           |\n|                 180 ml | Dark rum/whiskey/brandy                      |\n|    **BAKING THE CAKE** |                                              |\n|                  275 g | Flour                                        |\n|                  275 g | Salted butter (softened; extra for greasing) |\n|                  275 g | Brown sugar                                  |\n|                      5 | Eggs                                         |\n|                   75 g | Almonds                                      |\n|                   40 g | Cashewnuts                                   |\n|                   40 g | Pistachio                                    |\n|        From one orange | Orange zest                                  |\n|                  8 pcs | Cloves                                       |\n|             4-cm stick | Cinnamon                                     |\n|                  ¼ tsp | Nutmeg                                       |\n|                 15 pcs | Allspice berries (optional)                  |\n\n\n<amp-img alt=\"Equipments used in baking the cake\" \n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/q_auto:good/v1511470622/tools_v2_mmmg7w.png\"\n  width=\"1920\"\n  height=\"1111\"\n  layout=\"responsive\">\n</amp-img>\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Balloon whisk\n- Spatula\n- 9 × 4 inch rectangular loaf tin\n- Greaseproof baking paper\n- Aluminium foil (optional)\n- Weighing scale\n- Knife\n- Sieve\n- Grater\n\n## Appliances\n- OTG or convection oven (you can't bake this in microwave mode)\n- Grinder | spice grinder | mortar and pestle\n\n\n## Method\n### Soaking the fruits:\n<amp-youtube\n    data-videoid=\"Wgrv5ithNrg\"\n    layout=\"responsive\"\n    width=\"480\" height=\"270\">\n</amp-youtube>\n\n1. Chop dates, apricots, ginger, and orange peels into 1 cm chunks.\n2. Put the chopped dates, apricots, ginger, and orange peels along with the raisins, and the tutti frutti into an airtight glass jar.\n3. Pour 180 ml of dark rum (we are using Old Monk), or brandy, or whiskey or a mixture into the jar over the fruits.\n4. Shut the jar and leave it in a cool, dark place for 20 days. Give the jar a mild shake every couple of days.\n\n### Baking the cake:\n1. Grind the cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice to a fine powder. Also grind up the almonds separately. Set these aside.\n2.  Zest an entire orange, making sure not to grate any of the white pith as it is bitter. Chop up the cashew and pistachio into 5 mm pieces.\n3. Prepare the tin as explained above and set your oven to preheat at 150°C.\n4. In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter until it is airy and pale. Add in the brown sugar and cream again.\n5. Now whisk in the eggs, one at a time. Follow this with the ground almond, spice mix, and orange zest. Incorporate everything thoroughly. Get rid of your whisk; you won’t need it after this point. \n6. Sift in the flour and fold it in using a rubber spatula. Make sure to not overmix the batter after you add the flour as the cake may turn chewy.\n7. Add the chopped cashew and pistachio. Also add your rum-soaked dried fruits. The fruits should have absorbed all the alcohol, but if they contain excess liquid, strain and add just the fruits.\n8. Mix everything until well combined, but don’t overwork the batter.\n9. Spoon the batter into your prepared cake tin, pushing it into all the corners and leveling the top. Tap out any trapped air bubbles.\n10. Place it in the preheated oven and bake for 3.5 hours, checking on it regularly after the first 2 hours. Your cake is done when a thermometer inserted in the centre registers a temperature of 95°C, or when a skewer comes out clean. Your cake should develop a rich brown colour.   \n11. Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool completely in the tin. This should take about 5 hours or so.\n12. **Feed the cake:** This step is optional. Poke holes in the cake with a skewer. ‘Feed’ a spoon of rum, brandy, or whisky through the holes. You can do this once a week for as long as you want, until you are ready to cut the cake. Store it at room temperature wrapped in baking paper and aluminium foil. \n\n\n## Served with\n- A cup of Darjeeling or coffee\n- Mulled wine","source":"_posts/calcutta-christmas-fruitcake.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Calcutta Christmas Fruitcake\ntags:\n  - Christmas\n  - cake\n  - Calcutta-style food\n  - sweet\ndescription: >-\n  The classic Calcutta fruitcake—a fixture in many homes around\n  Christmas-time—is a rum-soaked, fruit-and-nut encrusted indulgence.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1513283979/fruitcake-website-thumbnail-_ptemcp.png\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: Cd0x661PujE\ndate: 2017-12-15 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Calcutta Christmas Fruitcake\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1511482556/cake_optimized_bftkad.jpg\",\"description\":\"The classic Calcutta fruitcake—a fixture in many homes around Christmas-time—is a rum-soaked, fruit-and-nut encrusted indulgence.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT2H\",\"totalTime\":\"PT4H\",\"recipeYield\":\"20\",\"nutrition\":{\"@type\":\"NutritionInformation\",\"servingSize\":\"20 servings\",\"calories\":\"316 calories\"}, \"recipeIngredient\":[\"100 g Raisins\",\"150 g Pitted dates\",\"100 g Dried apricots\",\"100 g Tutti frutti\",\"100 g Crystallised ginger\",\"125 g Orange/mixed peels\",\"180 ml Dark rum/whiskey/brandy\",\"275 g Flour\",\"275 g Butter (softened; extra for greasing)\",\"275 g Brown sugar\",\"5 Eggs\",\"75 g Almonds\",\"40 g Cashewnuts\",\"40 g Pistachios\",\"From one orange Orange zest\",\"8 pcs Cloves\",\"4-cm stick Cinnamon\",\"¼ tsp Nutmeg\",\"15 pcs Allspice berries (optional)\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

In a mixing bowl large enough to hold all the chicken combine the components of the marinade: that is, sliced onions, chopped garlic, ginger paste, chopped green chillies, yoghurt, turmeric powder (10 g), red chilli powder, garam masala powder, salt (10 g), lime juice, and raw mustard oil. Don’t throw the lime peel away.","2. Give these a good mix and then add the chicken to the bowl.","3. Coat the chicken pieces in the marinade, making sure to get into all the nooks and crannies of the chicken. If you are also cooking the chicken liver, don’t toss it in the marinade along with the other pieces of the chicken, as it might disintegrate. Instead, add the liver after all the chicken pieces are well coated, and smear the liver with the marinade.","4. Stick the used lime peel in between the chicken pieces.","5. Cover the bowl and rest the marinated chicken in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. For best results, leave it to marinate overnight.","6. Peel and divide the potatoes into 4-cm halves or quarters. Put these in a microwave-safe bowl, add 2 tablespoons of water, cover the bowl with a cling film, and microwave for about 3 to 4 minutes. Alternatively, you can also parboil the potatoes in water on the stove.","7. Cut the onions in thin slices. Thinly sliced onions, as opposed to roughly chopped or diced onions, give the curry the perfect texture.","8. Heat 30 g mustard oil in a kadai. Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, temper it with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns.","9. Add in the onions, along with the salt, and fry them for about 8 to 10 minutes, till the onions are brown in colour. (We add the sugar at this stage to help the onions caramelize quickly).","10. Once the onions have caramelized, add in the 8 g turmeric powder and 18 g salt, along with 75 g of water.","11. Fry the spices on medium heat till the water dries up. This should take about 5 minutes.","12. Add in the marinated chicken (don’t forget to remove the lime peel from the bowl!) to the kadai, and mix it with the onions in the pan. Cook the chicken on medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will ensure that the smell of raw spices from the marinade is gone.","13. Add in the parboiled potatoes and slit green chillies, and stir them in.","14. Add 400 g of hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.","15. Cover and let the curry bubble for about 15 to 20 minutes, or till the chicken and potatoes are tender.","16.

In a mixing bowl large enough to hold all the chicken, combine the components of the marinade: that is, sliced onions, chopped garlic, ginger paste, chopped green chillies, yoghurt, turmeric powder (10 g), red chilli powder, [_garam masala_](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/) powder, salt (10 g), lime juice, and raw mustard oil. Don’t throw the lime peel away.\n2. Give these a good mix and then add the chicken to the bowl.\n3. Coat the chicken pieces in the marinade, making sure to get into all the nooks and crannies of the chicken. If you are also cooking the chicken liver, don’t toss it in the marinade along with the other pieces of the chicken, as it might disintegrate. Instead, add the liver after all the chicken pieces are well coated, and smear the liver with the marinade then.\n4. Stick the used lime peel in between the chicken pieces.\n5. Cover the bowl and rest the marinated chicken in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. For best results, leave it to marinate overnight.\n\n**STEP II—PREPARING THE CURRY**\n1. Peel and divide the potatoes into 4-cm halves or quarters. Put these in a microwave-safe bowl, add 2 tablespoons of water, cover the bowl with a cling film, and microwave for about 3 to 4 minutes. Alternatively, you can also parboil the potatoes in water on the stove.\n2. Cut the onions in thin slices. Thinly sliced onions (as opposed to roughly chopped or diced onions) give the curry the perfect texture.\n3. Heat 30 g mustard oil in a _kadai_. Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, temper it with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns.\n4. Add in the onions, along with the sugar, and fry them for about 8 to 10 minutes, till the onions are brown in colour. (We add the sugar at this stage to help the onions caramelize quickly.)\n5. Once the onions have caramelized, add 8 g turmeric powder and 18 g salt, along with 75 g of water.\n6. Fry the spices on medium heat till the water dries up. This should take about 5 minutes.\n7. Tip the marinated chicken into the _kadai_ (don’t forget to remove the lime peel from the bowl!), and mix it with the onions in the pan. Cook the chicken on medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will ensure that the smell of raw spices from the marinade is gone.\n8. Add in the parboiled potatoes and slit green chillies, and stir them in.\n8. Add 400 g of hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n9. Cover the pan and let the curry bubble for about 15 to 20 minutes, or till the chicken and potatoes are tender.\n10. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves.  \n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- Roti | [Luchi](/recipe/luchi/)\n- [Fried rice](/recipe/bengali-vegetable-fried-rice/)\n","source":"_posts/chicken-curry.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Chicken Curry\ntags:\n  - chicken\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\ndescription: >-\n  A hot, spicy, and delicious Bengali chicken curry, packed full of the flavours\n  of ginger, garlic, and shahi garam masala.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1490315506/chicken-curry-website-thumbnail_xc4csh.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: u6vCNSosGrc\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Chicken Curry or Kosha\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1490315506/chicken-curry-website-thumbnail_xc4csh.jpg\",\"description\":\"  A hot, spicy, and delicious Bengali chicken curry, packed full of the flavours of ginger, garlic, and shahi garam masala.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT30M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT90M\",\"recipeYield\":\"6 servings\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"Onions (sliced) 25 g\",\"Garlic (finely chopped) 8 g\",\"Dried red chillies 2 pcs\",\"Green chillies (finely chopped) 2 pcs\",\"Ginger paste 25 g\",\"Yoghurt 60 g\",\"Turmeric powder 10 g\",\"Red chilli powder 2 g\",\"Garam masala powder 2 g\",\"Salt 10 g\",\"Lime juice 5 g\",\"Mustard oil 10 g\",\"FOR THE CURRY Chicken (cut and cleaned) 1 kg\",\"Potatoes (halved or quartered) 200 g\",\"Onions (thinly sliced) 300 g\",\"Mustard oil 30 g\",\"Dried red chillies 2 pcs\",\"Bay leaves 2 pcs\",\"Cardamom 3 pcs\",\"Cloves 3 pcs\",\"Cinnamon 1 pc\",\"Peppercorns 8 pcs\",\"Turmeric powder\",\"Salt 18 g\",\"Sugar 10 g\",\"Coriander leaves (optional; finely chopped) 10 g\",\"Green chillies (slit) 2 pcs\",\"Hot water 400 g\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

Rinse the _chhola’r dal_ well and soak it in water for at least 2 hours. After this time, strain the _dal_ and transfer it to a boiling pot or pressure cooker. Add 700 g water, 6 g salt, and the bay leaves. Boil the _dal_ until it is tender, but the grains are still whole. The texture of this dish will depend a whole lot on how well the _dal_ is boiled. We want each grain of lentil to be perfectly cooked, but not turned to mush. On medium heat, our _chhola’r dal_ cooks to the desired doneness in 2 whistles. The time may vary for you.\n2. Before you begin cooking, make a spice slurry by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder and 50 g water. Also, slice the coconut and slit the green chillies. \n3. Heat mustard oil in a pan (on medium heat) and once it starts to smoke lightly and changes colour to a pale yellow, add the thinly sliced coconut. Fry until the coconut turns golden brown. This should take about a minute. Remove from the oil and set aside. \n4. Temper the same oil with the dried red chillies, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. Stir in the _hing_, allowing it to fry for about 10 seconds. \n5. Add the spice slurry we made earlier to the pan. Fry on medium heat until the raw smell of the spices is gone. This should take about 6 minutes. Add the slit green chillies and raisins, and continue frying until you see oil leaving the sides of the spice mixture. \n6. Now add the boiled _dal_ along with the water to the pan. (If you feel there’s a lot of excess water with the _dal_, reserve some in a bowl.) \n7. Add the remaining salt (12 g) and allow the _dal_ to bubble until it thickens (about 6 to 8 minutes). Depending on how soft or hard your _dal_ is, you may have to adjust the flame and water accordingly. For example, if your _dal_ is still slightly hard, boil on low heat, adding water to maintain consistency, until it is cooked. If it is on the softer, mushier side (first of all, you need to make note of where you went wrong and try correcting the boiling time on your next attempt!), turn up the flame to thicken the dal quickly. \n8. Pick out a softened green chilli from the _dal_, mash it with the back of a spoon and add it back to the dal. Add the sugar and bubble for about a minute before stirring in the _ghee_, [_Bengali garam masala_](/recipe/bengali-garam-masala), and fried coconut. Allow the _dal_ to rest, covered, for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Luchi](/recipe/luchi/)\n- [Begun bhaja](/recipe/begun-bhaja)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- [Bengali fried rice](/recipe/bengali-vegetable-fried-rice/)","slug":"cholar-dal","published":1,"updated":"2017-12-01T05:16:30.428Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjcles71u000q0wvhmyo2jsrb","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">Savoury-sweet preparation of curried split Bengal gram</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Breakfast, lunch, dinner—this is a dal recipe for all occasions.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">E</span>very family has its own the classic Bengali <em>chholar dal</em> recipe.

Gather together all the walking legs (can be found under the head) and snip them off with your scissors as well.\n4. Now, hold the prawn so that its head faces you, and its dorsal side is pointed upward. Cut through the shell along the (non-existent) spine of the prawn, from the head all the way to the tail.\n5.

Rinse and soak the dal in water overnight (at least 12 hours). Drain it from the water and transfer it to a saucepan.\n2. Add 800 g water, 10 g salt, and 20 g onions to the the saucepan. Cover and boil the dal on low heat. The dal should be soft but remain unbroken. So be sure to keep an eye on it so that it doesn’t disintegrate. Once done, strain the dal and reserve the water for later. \n3. Cut potatoes into 1.5-cm cubes, onions and coconut into thin slices, and roughly chop the tomato. Also crush the garlic and green chillies into a paste using a mortar and pestle.\n4. Set a pan on medium heat and add 15 g mustard oil with 5 g ghee. Once hot, add the coconut slices and fry them until they are golden-brown. Remove them from the oil and set aside. Temper the oil with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. \n5. Once the whole spices are crackling, add the onions and fry them until brown. This should take about 6 minutes. Next add the potatoes and fry for 3 minutes before adding the tomatoes. Cook the tomatoes until they are soft (about 2 minutes).\n6. Add the garlic-and-green-chilli paste, and ginger paste. Fry these for about 3 minutes. During this time, make a paste of turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, kashmiri red chilli powder, and 100 g water. Add it to the pan.\n7. Fry until the smell of raw spices is gone. This should take about 8 to 10 minutes. If the spices dry out, add a splash of the dal water that we reserved earlier and continue frying.\n8. Once the spices have started releasing their oils, add the boiled _motor_ dal to the pan. Fold it with the spices and cook for 2 minutes before add the reserved water. \n9. Add the remaining salt and sugar and turn up the heat. Bubble on high flame for about 6 minutes until the curry loses its watery consistency. Stir in two slit green chillies and the fried coconut. Cover and rest for 2 minutes.\n10. Before serving, garnish with [_Bhaja masala_](https://youtu.be/gGmCPwauVBs), chopped onions, chopped green chillies and tamarind pulp. Serve piping hot.  \n\n\n## Served with\n- White quarter pound bread loaves toasted over an open flame\n- Luchi","slug":"ghugni","published":1,"updated":"2017-10-06T06:36:56.815Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjcles72g00140wvhzl1ny217","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">Spicy, curried snack made with yellow peas</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Ghugni is an iconic vegetarian Bengali snack made with dried yellow peas and served with luchi or pauruti</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">G</span>hugni is one of the most beloved of Bengali snacks.

Soak the mustard seeds in hot water for at least 2 hours. Alternatively, you can also soak them in regular water, overnight.\n2. Shell and devein the prawns. Keep the heads intact; they have all the flavour. The tails add a visual flair, so we keep them as well.\n3. Strain the mustard seeds and add to a grinder jar, along with the salt and 3 green chillies.\n4. Blitz into a fine paste with the help of 50 g water. Scrape down the sides as often as you need, and grind again. Repeat this process till you have a smooth paste.\n5. Now, while the mustard paste is still in the grinder, add the sugar, turmeric powder, and chopped coconut. Blitz again till the coconut breaks down.\n6. Transfer this paste to a microwave-safe bowl.\n7. Add in the yoghurt and mix till uniform.\n8. Fold in the prawns.\n9. Top off with mustard oil and a slit green chilli.\n10. Cover the bowl with a plastic wrap.\n11. Microwave for 5 minutes.\n12. IF YOU ARE NOT USING A MICROWAVE OVEN, place the prawns-and-mustard mixture in a covered steel container (such as a water-tight tiffin box). Bring an inch of water to boil in your pressure cooker or boiling pot. Now, carefully lower the tiffin box in the water. Be sure to check that the water level does not does not reach the lid of your tiffin box. If it does, throw away some of the water till it clears the lid. Cover up the pot/pressure cooker and allow the prawns to steam (for 10–12 minutes in the boiling pot OR for one whistle in a pressure cooker).  \n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n","source":"_posts/chingri-bhaape.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Chingri Bhaape | Prawns Steamed in Mustard Sauce\ndescription: A traditional Bengali dish of Prawns or shrimps steamed in a sharp mustard and yoghurt sauce.

While there are innumerable ways of boiling rice and there appears to be no set formula, keeping a few things in mind is useful. (1) Washing the rice thoroughly and repeatedly helps get rid of the starch that usually contributes to its stickiness. (2) Rice, like pasta, must be boiled in a large pot of water. The water must measure at least 5 times in volume than the volume of uncooked rice. Doing so dilutes the starch and ensures that most of it gets drained out at the end, along with the water. (3) Once the rice is cooked to the desired softness, use a large strainer to remove the excess water. Letting the rice sit in the boiled, starchy water (or not draining off as much of the liquid as possible) will yield a sticky, mushy end product. (4) Sometimes, the iron content in the water tends to produce yellowish rice. For fluffy, white rice, you may add a tablespoon of vinegar or a teaspoon of _fitkari_ (alum) to the boiling pot. (5) Finally, as for boiling time, it will depend on the rice and water you use. Ours usually takes about 25 minutes. We highly recommend that you determine the cooking time for _your_ rice. Once you've done that, set a timer whenever you put a pot to boil. When the timer goes off, all you need to do is drain out the water, and you have perfectly cooked rice every single time.      \n\n***\n\n**TIME TAKEN** 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the rice and water you use\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient         |\n|----------|--------------------|\n|    1 cup | Rice               |\n|   5 cups | Water              |\n|   1 tbsp | Vinegar (optional) |\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot | saucepan\n- Lid for the boiling vessel\n- Large strainer | colander\n\n## Appliance\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1.

Grown in vast quantities in paddy fields across the region, rice is eaten in various forms—boiled, steamed, puffed, or beaten. While the keeper of the Bengali kitchen might break out the precious <em>gobindobhog</em> for <em>polao</em>, <em>payesh</em>, or <em>khichuri</em>, and the <em>basmati</em> for <em>biryani</em>, it is the <em>sheddho chal</em>, or parboiled rice, that is piled onto plates daily. <em>Sheddho chal</em> is named after the technique used to separate the grain from the husk. This process is said to enhance the nutritional profile of the rice and make it easier to digest.</p>\n<p>There is something extremely satisfying in sitting down to a meal before a plate of perfectly cooked, non-sticky, pearly-white, fluffy rice. While there are innumerable ways of boiling rice and there appears to be no set formula, keeping a few things in mind is useful. (1) Washing the rice thoroughly and repeatedly helps get rid of the starch that usually contributes to its stickiness. (2) Rice, like pasta, must be boiled in a large pot of water. The water must measure at least 5 times in volume than the volume of uncooked rice. Doing so dilutes the starch and ensures that most of it gets drained out at the end, along with the water. (3) Once the rice is cooked to the desired softness, use a large strainer to remove the excess water. Letting the rice sit in the boiled, starchy water (or not draining off as much of the liquid as possible) will yield a sticky, mushy end product. (4) Sometimes, the iron content in the water tends to produce yellowish rice. For fluffy, white rice, you may add a tablespoon of vinegar or a teaspoon of <em>fitkari</em> (alum) to the boiling pot. (5) Finally, as for boiling time, it will depend on the rice and water you use. Ours usually takes about 25 minutes. We highly recommend that you determine the cooking time for <em>your</em> rice. Once you’ve done that, set a timer whenever you put a pot to boil. When the timer goes off, all you need to do is drain out the water, and you have perfectly cooked rice every single time.      </p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>TIME TAKEN</strong> 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the rice and water you use</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1 cup</td>\n<td>Rice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 cups</td>\n<td>Water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 tbsp</td>\n<td>Vinegar (optional)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Boiling pot | saucepan</li>\n<li>Lid for the boiling vessel</li>\n<li>Large strainer | colander</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliance\"><a href=\"#Appliance\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliance\"></a>Appliance</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Measure out the rice and place it in a boiling vessel.</li>\n<li>Fill the pot with water and wash the rice thoroughly to remove dirt and any excess starch.

All across the country, residents and travellers alike can be seen eating this hearty concoction of cheese and chillies. Apart from Bhutan, this preparation is also consumed in several parts of Northeast India and Nepal. ‘Ema’ and ‘datshi’ literally stand for ‘chillies’ and ‘cheese’, and as such can be made using one or more varieties of either ingredient. ‘Datshi’ is also used to refer to any cheese-based soup (the version with potatoes, for example, is called ‘kewa datshi’ where ‘kewa’ means potatoes). </p>\n<p>This dish can be prepared using an assortment of chilli peppers for flavour. We’ve used jalapeños, but look for slightly large chillies such as those commonly used for <em>achar</em> or pickles. We’ve combined them with green chillies, which provide the heat. As for cheese, any good, locally available melting cheese (such as that commonly found in New Market in Calcutta) will do. In a pinch, you can also use processed cheese.

Using a slicer, cut the potatoes into 2-mm-thick slices. Alternatively, you can also use a sharp knife cut thin slices by hand. Reserve the slices in a large bowl of water to prevent the potatoes from oxidizing.\n2. Wash the potato slices in plenty of water to remove the starch. Doing so will allow the _alu bhaja_ to crisp up nicely. Change the water 2–3 times during this process to make sure that most of the starch is gone. Drain the water when done.\n3. Now, lay out absorbent towels on a surface and spread out the washed potato slices in a single layer. We want the potatoes to be completely dry before we move on to the next stage—moisture will make the fries limp. Take your time. Dab them with another towel, or let them air dry for long as it takes for them to be completely dry.\n4. Bunch together 5–6 slices at a time, and chop them into matchsticks, 2-mm-wide.\n5. Heat about 500 g vegetable oil in a pan. The secret to non-greasy fries is to use a lot of oil. The excessive amount of oil will allow the potato juliennes to float freely, rather than lump together and trap steam. The temperature of the oil is also important for this recipe. It should be adequately hot (at around 180°C), but should never reach the smoking point.\n6. Once the oil is hot, fry the peanuts for 20 seconds, drain, and reserve for later. Do the same with the curry leaves, frying them for 10 seconds.\n7. Now, drop a small handful of potatoes into the oil. It is important not to overcrowd the pan. When the potatoes hit the oil, they will release a lot of steam. With time, the bubbles will gradually start subsiding (in about 3 minutes or so). The process of frying essentially serves to dehydrate the potatoes—and _that_ is what lets them turn crisp, and stay crisp, longer. When the moisture has evaporated as steam bubbles, you know that the _alu bhaja_ is crunchy. Fry for another 2 minutes for it to develop colour.\n7. Strain the _alu bhaja_ from the oil, and transfer to a perforated vessel (such as a colander or wicker basket) to cool. A basket allows the remaining steam to get out. Otherwise the steam will condense into water as the fries cool, making them limp.\n8. Garnish with the fried peanuts and curry leaves.\n9. FOR THE SEASONING, mix together the freshly ground pepper, salt, rock salt, chaat masala, and red chilli powder in the given proportions. Sprinkle this mix on the _alu bhaja_ just before eating. Salt, being hygroscopic, tends to absorb moisture from the air, and turn the crisps soggy.

Three important things need to be kept in mind: (1) The cut potatoes should be washed in plenty of water to rid them of starch; (2) before frying, the potatoes must be thoroughly dried—any moisture will yield limp fries; and (3) the potato juliennes must be fried in a pan full of oil, at a steady temperature of 180°C (that is, the oil should be hot, but not so hot that it begins to smoke).</p>\n\n<p>Without further ado, let’s get into the step-by-step guide to making the perfectly crisp <em>jhuri alu bhaja</em> every single time.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 45 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 8 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>400 g</td>\n<td>Potatoes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25 g</td>\n<td>Peanuts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 sprig</td>\n<td>Curry leaves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>500 g</td>\n<td>Vegetable oil (for frying)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Pepper (crushed)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Rock salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Chaat masala</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pinch</td>\n<td>Red chilli powder</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Any good slicer</li>\n<li>Sharp knife</li>\n<li>2–3 clean, absorbent towels</li>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan</li>\n<li>Frying spoon | perforated spoon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Using a slicer, cut the potatoes into 2-mm-thick slices. Alternatively, you can also use a sharp knife cut thin slices by hand. Reserve the slices in a large bowl of water to prevent the potatoes from oxidizing.</li>\n<li>Wash the potato slices in plenty of water to remove the starch. Doing so will allow the <em>alu bhaja</em> to crisp up nicely. Change the water 2–3 times during this process to make sure that most of the starch is gone. Drain the water when done.</li>\n<li>Now, lay out absorbent towels on a surface and spread out the washed potato slices in a single layer. We want the potatoes to be completely dry before we move on to the next stage—moisture will make the fries limp. Take your time. Dab them with another towel, or let them air dry for long as it takes for them to be completely dry.</li>\n<li>Bunch together 5–6 slices at a time, and chop them into matchsticks, 2-mm-wide.</li>\n<li>Heat about 500 g vegetable oil in a pan. The secret to non-greasy fries is to use a lot of oil. The excessive amount of oil will allow the potato juliennes to float freely, rather than lump together and trap steam. The temperature of the oil is also important for this recipe. It should be adequately hot (at around 180°C), but should never reach the smoking point.</li>\n<li>Once the oil is hot, fry the peanuts for 20 seconds, drain, and reserve for later. Do the same with the curry leaves, frying them for 10 seconds.</li>\n<li>Now, drop a small handful of potatoes into the oil. It is important not to overcrowd the pan. When the potatoes hit the oil, they will release a lot of steam. With time, the bubbles will gradually start subsiding (in about 3 minutes or so). The process of frying essentially serves to dehydrate the potatoes—and <em>that</em> is what lets them turn crisp, and stay crisp, longer. When the moisture has evaporated as steam bubbles, you know that the <em>alu bhaja</em> is crunchy. Fry for another 2 minutes for it to develop colour.</li>\n<li>Strain the <em>alu bhaja</em> from the oil, and transfer to a perforated vessel (such as a colander or wicker basket) to cool. A basket allows the remaining steam to get out. Otherwise the steam will condense into water as the fries cool, making them limp.</li>\n<li>Garnish with the fried peanuts and curry leaves.</li>\n<li>FOR THE SEASONING, mix together the freshly ground pepper, salt, rock salt, chaat masala, and red chilli powder in the given proportions. Sprinkle this mix on the <em>alu bhaja</em> just before eating. Salt, being hygroscopic, tends to absorb moisture from the air, and turn the crisps soggy. Without the seasoning, the <em>alu bhaja</em> should keep for up to 7 days in an airtight container.  </li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Served-with\"><a href=\"#Served-with\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Served with\"></a>Served with</h2><ul>\n<li><a href=\"/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/\">Rice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/tags/dal/\">Dal</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"title":"Keema’r Doi Bora","description":"Keema’r doi bora—warm meat koftas topped with chilled yoghurt—is a meaty twist on the beloved Indian snack, the dahi vada.","thumbnailImagePosition":"top","thumbnailImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1493922330/keemar-doi-bora-website-thumbnail-_htoo1u.jpg","coverMeta":"out","coverSize":"partial","videoId":"RNZaVFTx5cA","jsonLd":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Recipe","name":"Keema'r Doi Bora","author":"Bong Eats","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1493922330/keemar-doi-bora-website-thumbnail-_htoo1u.jpg","description":"Keema’r doi bora—warm meat koftas topped with chilled yoghurt—is a meaty twist on the beloved Indian snack, the dahi vada.","prepTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT60M","recipeYield":"4","recipeIngredient":["Beef or mutton keema (mince) 300 g","Maida (all-purpose flour) 50 g","Onions (finely chopped) 85 g","Green chillies (finely chopped) 4 pcs","Shahi garam masala powder 1 tsp","Salt 7 g","Potatoes (boiled and peeled) 90 g","Beaten egg 30 g","Yoghurt 150 g","Mint leaves 2 g","Bhaja masala ¼ tsp","Sugar 5 g","Ghee ½ tsp","Tamarind sauce 1 tbsp"],"recipeInstructions":["1 In a bowl, add the yoghurt, chopped mint leaves, bhaja masala, 2 g salt, and 5 g sugar.

Even after two centuries, the Tagores define every aspect of what it means to be a Bengali—be it music, literature, art, philosophy, politics, or food.</p>\n<p>Rabindranath grew up in a household with a deep knowledge of ancient Hindu as well as Islamic traditions. He travelled all over the world, imbibing the best aspects of every culture he encountered. He loved collecting menu cards and recipes from dinners and lunches on his travels. He would bring them back to his wife, Mrinalini, and request that the recipes be incorporated into the repertoire of the Tagore kitchen. According to accounts, some of his experiments with food were downright whimsical (pureed-garlic fritters, anyone?)</p>\n<p>Indira Devi Chaudhurani (daughter of Satyendranath Tagore) was one of Rabindranath’s favourite nieces.

Rinse _gobindobhog_ rice thoroughly, spread it it over a colander or net, and leave it to air-dry completely.\n2. Cut potatoes in 5-cm chunks, cauliflower into 5-cm florets, and tomatoes into quarters. Shell and blanch the peas.\n3. Set a _kadai_ on medium heat and add the _moong dal_ to it. Dry-roast the _dal_ for about 6 minutes or till it turns pinkish-brown giving off a nutty aroma. Stir continuously throughout to get an even roast.\n4. Once roasted, transfer the _dal_ to a large bowl or saucepan, and wash it. Rinse just once; overrinsing will cause the _moong dal_ to lose its nutty scent. Strain over a colander and set aside.\n5. Back in the _kadai_, heat 5 g vegetable oil. Add the washed _gobindobhog_ rice to it.\n6. Fry the rice for about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently, till it takes on a glassy look. Frying activates the sweet smell of _gobindobhog_ rice. Once done, transfer the rice to a plate; set aside.\n7. In the same _kadai_, add 15 g more vegetable oil. Fry the potatoes till they develop a golden film. Remove from oil and set aside. Add the cauliflower to the pan, fry till the florets are lightly coloured, and set those aside too.\n8. In a small bowl, mix the ginger paste, turmeric powder, and cumin powder with 50 g water. Keep it ready. Also set water to boil on the stove or in an electric kettle.\n9. Now, add 15 g mustard oil to the pan, set on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, temper it with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. \n10. Add the grated coconut. Fry for about 3 minutes until the coconut turns golden.\n11. Add the ginger-turmeric-cumin paste to the pan. Fry the spices on medium heat till the their raw smell is gone and oil starts oozing from the mixture. This should take about 8 minutes. If you find during this time that the mixture has run dry, add about 50 g more water and continue frying.\n12. Add the tomatoes, cover, and cook for about 2 minutes. \n13. Next, add the fried _gobindobhog_ rice, roasted _moond dal_, and 2 slit green chillies. Stir them into the spices and cook for about 2 minutes.\n14. Add 1.8 litres of hot water along with the salt. Cover the pan and allow its contents to boil for about 5 minutes. The heat should be set at low from this point onwards.\n15. Once the water is bubbling, add the fried potatoes and cauliflower. Cover and cook for about 15 minutes. _Dal_ tends to settle at the bottom and stick to the pan, so don’t forget to stir occasionally, scraping the bottom thoroughly. \n16. After 15 minutes, add the sugar, blanched peas, and 3 more slit green chillies. Stir everything in and cook for 3 to 4 more minutes.\n17. Garnish with ghee and garam masala powder. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and allow the _khichuri_ to rest for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Panchmishali torkari](/recipe/panchmishali-torkari/)\n- Papad\n- Omelette\n- [Begun bhaja](/recipe/begun-bhaja/)\n","slug":"khichuri","published":1,"updated":"2017-07-07T02:21:59.428Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjcles739001u0wvh6c6wtqah","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">The Bengali variant of ‘khichdi’ made with roasted moong dal and fragrant <em>gobindobhog</em> rice</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\"><em>Khichuri</em> is one of those rare dishes that effortlessly strides the boundary between what’s considered ‘ordinary’ and ‘special’ when it comes to cooking.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">I</span>f there is one common thread linking the varied and multitudinous South Asian cuisines, it is <em>khichuri</em>.

Chopping off the root will ensure that each strand separates from the rest.","Heat vegetable oil, 3 cm deep, on medium heat. Once hot, drop a handful of the onion slices. Be sure not to overcrowd the pan; the onions must fry in a single layer.","Using a fork, move the onions around every so often so that they fry evenly.","Just as the onions start to turn golden (do not wait until they have already turned golden), start removing them from the pan and draining them over a perforated vessel such as a colander or jhuri. Keep a close watch, as the onions tend to burn very quickly towards the end. Remove them from the oil before they have taken on the desired colour; they will continue to cook in the residual heat.","Allow them to cool and crisp up. This caramelised onion is called birasta and it is used in several Mughlai preparations. Raw onions weighing 650 g should yield about 165 g birasta (so about 25 per cent the weight of raw onions). It can be stored in an airtight container for 2 to 3 weeks.","Using a grinder or mortar and pestle, form a smooth paste of 15 g ginger, 10 g garlic, and 10 g green chillies. Set aside.","In a kadai, heat 35 g vegetable oil. Once hot, fry the meat in batches, from all sides, till it is golden. Browning the meat enhances the flavour of the dish.","Remove from the pan and set aside.","Temper the same oil with bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns.","Add 350 g sliced onions, along with 15 g salt. Stirring intermittently, fry on medium heat for about 10 minutes till the onions turn brown.","Next, add in the ginger-garlic-green-chilli paste and fry for another 3 minutes, until the smell of the raw spices is gone.","Add shahi garam masala powder and 35 g of the birasta we prepared earlier. Using a combination of sautéed and caramelised onions adds a depth of flavour to the preparation.","Add the browned pieces of meat to the onion mixture and sauté for about 2 minutes.","Transfer everything from the kadai to a pressure cooker. Add 1.5 kg of water, close the lid, and pressure cook for about 1 hour. The meat should be completely soft by this stage, such that it easily falls off the bone.","Pick out the meat pieces from the pressure cooker. Just as they are cool enough to handle, remove the bones, cartilage, and any hard, unrendered collagen that is still in the meat. Discard these, along with the bay leaves.","You should now be left with a gorgeous meaty broth, and some boneless pieces of tender meat. At this stage, you can put the meat and broth in the fridge and complete the rest of the preparation the following day.","Chop the meat, against the grain, into 3-cm chunks. Chilling the meat before chopping hardens the collagen rendered from the meat, making it easy to cut into cubes.","Divide the meat into two piles. The first will be ground along with the grains, and the second added whole to the haleem towards the end.","Strain the water from the soaked grains, and transfer the latter to a heavy-bottomed pan. Add the broth we prepared earlier to the pan. (If you placed the broth in the fridge overnight, do not forget to first bring it to boil before adding it to the grains.)","Also add 18 g of salt and the first pile of the chopped meat.","On low heat, let it all bubble for at least one hour, stirring occasionally, till the the grains are soft. Boiling the grains in the broth rather than in water intensifies the meaty flavour of the dish.","Transfer the boiled grains into a blender and grind till everything breaks down. However, be careful not to reduce everything to a uniform, smooth paste, as we want some semblance of texture. Depending on the size of your blender jar, you may have to do this in batches.","Return the haleem to the pan. Add the remaining chunks of meat, along with 650 g hot milk. Mix until uniform. Bring to a boil before turning off the heat.","For the garnish, julienne some ginger, cut limes into wedges, split green chillies lengthwise, and finely chop the mint leaves.","Drop ladles of the haleem into a serving dish. Top it with a generous amount of birasta and chopped mint leaves.","Heat a pan till it is extremely hot. Add a spoonful of ghee and wait for it to smoke. Then add some julienned ginger and split green chillies.

By some accounts, Calcutta is estimated to have under 5,000 'Bohris'. Mostly traders and businessfolk, the earliest settlers arrived in the city from western parts of India in the late 1800s</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">K</span>_hichro_ is a typically Bohra Muslim preparation. Like the more popular _haleem_ found in Calcutta during Ramzan, _khichro_ is made by slowly cooking meat and grains together till the meat falls off the bone. _Khichro_ is a special dish, being most prominently consumed communally on the tenth day of Muharram by Bohras across the globe, but it is also a very homely preparation, eaten throughout the year. It is deceptively light. In spite of the fact that a lot of onions, spices, meat, milk, and ghee goes into the dish, it is, underneath all that, a very hearty porridge of various kinds of grains. The _khichro_ is distinctive in that it is pale in colour; it doesn’t make use of turmeric powder, chilli powder, jeera powder, and other such spices. Apart from meat, its main ingredient is broken wheat (dalia can also be used), whereas _haleem_ is made predominantly with a mixture of dals.\n\n| Day 1                             | Day 2                        |  \n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Soaking grains                    | Chopping meat                |\n| Making _birasta_                  | Cooking grains               |\n| Cooking meat                      | Blending everything together |\n| Separating meat, stock, and bones | Garnishing                   |\n\n\n**COOKING TIME** 5 hours   \n**YIELDS** 6 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|         Quantity | Ingredient                            |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|       **GRAINS** |                                       |\n|            180 g | Broken wheat or dalia                 |\n|             30 g | Masoor dal                            |\n|             30 g | Moong dal                             |\n|             30 g | Chhola’r dal                          |\n|             30 g | Rice                                  |\n| **FOR THE MEAT** |                                       |\n|            800 g | Beef (or any red meat of your choice) |\n|             1 kg | Onions                                |\n|             15 g | Ginger                                |\n|             10 g | Garlic                                |\n|             10 g | Green chillies                        |\n|            6 pcs | Cardamom (whole)                      |\n|            2 pcs | Cinnamon (whole)                      |\n|            6 pcs | Cloves (whole)                        |\n|           10 pcs | Peppercorns                           |\n|            2 pcs | Bay leaves                            |\n|              3 g | [Shahi garam masala powder](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/)             |\n|             33 g | Salt                                  |\n|      **LIQUIDS** |                                       |\n|           1.5 kg | Water                                 |\n|            650 g | Milk                                  |\n|          **FAT** |                                       |\n|            250 g | Vegetable oil                         |\n|             50 g | Ghee                                  |\n|      **GARNISH** |                                       |\n|          1 bunch | Mint leaves                           |\n|             40 g | Ginger                                |\n|        12 wedges | Lime                                  |\n|            6 pcs | Green chillies                        |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Large dish or pot (for soaking grains)\n- Heavy-bottomed boiling pot with lid\n- Pressure cooker\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- _Khhunti_ | long stapula\n- _Jhhajhhri_ | perforated frying spoon\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Grinder\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—SOAKING GRAINS**\n1. Take the broken wheat, dals, and rice in a bowl. Rinse them well and soak overnight, for at least 12 hours.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING ONIONS (_BIRASTA_)**\n1. Slice 650g onions thinly, cutting off the root that holds the bulb together.\n2. Using you hand, scrunch up the slices to separate each layer. Chopping off the root will ensure that each strand separates from the rest.\n3. Heat vegetable oil, 3 cm deep, on medium heat. Once hot, drop a handful of the onion slices. Be sure not to overcrowd the pan; the onions must fry in a single layer.\n4. Using a fork, move the onions around every so often so that they fry evenly.\n5. Just as the onions start to turn golden (do not wait until they have already turned golden), start removing them from the pan and draining them over a perforated vessel such as a colander or _jhuri_. Keep a close watch, as the onions tend to burn very quickly towards the end. Remove them from the oil _before_ they have taken on the desired colour; they will continue to cook in the residual heat.\n6. Allow them to cool and crisp up. This caramelised onion is called _birasta_ and it is used in several Mughlai preparations. Raw onions weighing 650 g should yield about 165 g _birasta_ (so about 25 per cent the weight of raw onions). It can be stored in an airtight container for 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n**STEP III—COOKING MEAT**\n1. Using a grinder or mortar and pestle, form a smooth paste of 15 g ginger, 10 g garlic, and 10 g green chillies. Set aside.\n2. In a _kadai_, heat 35 g vegetable oil. Once hot, fry the meat in batches, from all sides, till it is golden. Browning the meat enhances the flavour of the dish.\n3. Remove from the pan and set aside.\n4. Temper the same oil with bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns.\n5. Add 350 g sliced onions, along with 15 g salt. Stirring intermittently, fry on medium heat for about 10 minutes till the onions turn brown.\n6. Next, add in the ginger-garlic-green-chilli paste and fry for another 3 minutes, until the smell of the raw spices is gone.\n7. Add [_Shahi garam masala_](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/) powder and 35 g of the _birasta_ we prepared earlier. Using a combination of sautéed and caramelised onions adds a depth of flavour to the preparation.\n8. Add the browned pieces of meat to the onion mixture and sauté for about 2 minutes.\n10. Transfer everything from the _kadai_ to a pressure cooker. Add 1.5 kg of water, close the lid, and pressure cook for about 1 hour. The meat should be completely soft by this stage, such that it easily falls off the bone.\n\n**STEP IV—SEPARATING MEAT, BROTH, AND BONES**\n1. Pick out the meat pieces from the pressure cooker. Just as they are cool enough to handle, remove the bones, cartilage, and any hard, unrendered collagen that is still in the meat. Discard these, along with the bay leaves.\n2. You should now be left with a gorgeous meaty broth, and some boneless pieces of tender meat. At this stage, you can put the meat and broth in the fridge and complete the rest of the preparation the following day.\n\n**STEP V—CHOPPING MEAT**\n1. Chop the meat, against the grain, into 3-cm chunks. Chilling the meat before chopping hardens the collagen rendered from the meat, making it easy to cut into cubes.\n2. Divide the meat into two piles. The first will be ground along with the grains, and the second added whole to the haleem towards the end.\n\n**STEP VI—BOILING GRAINS**\n1. Strain the water from the soaked grains, and transfer the latter to a heavy-bottomed pan. Add the broth we prepared earlier to the pan. (If you placed the broth in the fridge overnight, do not forget to first bring it to  boil before adding it to the grains.)\n2. Also add 18 g of salt and the first pile of the chopped meat.\n3. On low heat, let it all bubble for at least one hour, stirring occasionally, till the the grains are soft. Boiling the grains in the broth rather than in water intensifies the meaty flavour of the dish.\n\n**STEP VII—BLENDING EVERYTHING**\n1. Transfer the boiled grains into a blender and grind till everything breaks down. However, be careful not to reduce everything to a uniform, smooth paste, as we want some semblance of texture. Depending on the size of your blender jar, you may have to do this in batches.\n2. Return the _haleem_ to the pan. Add the remaining chunks of meat, along with 650 g hot milk. Mix until uniform. Bring to a boil before turning off the heat.\n\n**STEP VIII—GARNISHING**\n1. For the garnish, julienne some ginger, cut limes into wedges, split green chillies lengthwise, and finely chop the mint leaves.\n2. Drop ladles of the _haleem_ into a serving dish. Top it with a generous amount of _birasta_ and chopped mint leaves.\n3. Heat a pan till it is extremely hot. Add a spoonful of ghee and wait for it to smoke. Then add some julienned ginger and split green chillies. Fry for about 5 seconds and pour the contents of the pan (along with the ghee) over the serving dish.\n\n\n## Served with\n- Bread rolls\n","source":"_posts/khichra-bohra-haleem.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Khichra—Bohra-Style Haleem\ntags:\n  - snack\n  - street food\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - ramzan recipe\n  - bohra recipe\ndescription: >-\n  Khichra, the Bohri version of haleem, is hearty dish is made by stewing meat, wheat and pulses.

By some accounts, Calcutta is estimated to have under 5,000 'Bohris'. Mostly traders and businessfolk, the earliest settlers arrived in the city from western parts of India in the late 1800s</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">K</span>_hichro_ is a typically Bohra Muslim preparation. Like the more popular _haleem_ found in Calcutta during Ramzan, _khichro_ is made by slowly cooking meat and grains together till the meat falls off the bone. _Khichro_ is a special dish, being most prominently consumed communally on the tenth day of Muharram by Bohras across the globe, but it is also a very homely preparation, eaten throughout the year. It is deceptively light. In spite of the fact that a lot of onions, spices, meat, milk, and ghee goes into the dish, it is, underneath all that, a very hearty porridge of various kinds of grains.

Chop the meat, against the grain, into 3-cm chunks. Chilling the meat before chopping hardens the collagen rendered from the meat, making it easy to cut into cubes.\n2. Divide the meat into two piles. The first will be ground along with the grains, and the second added whole to the haleem towards the end.\n\n**STEP VI—BOILING GRAINS**\n1. Strain the water from the soaked grains, and transfer the latter to a heavy-bottomed pan. Add the broth we prepared earlier to the pan. (If you placed the broth in the fridge overnight, do not forget to first bring it to  boil before adding it to the grains.)\n2. Also add 18 g of salt and the first pile of the chopped meat.\n3. On low heat, let it all bubble for at least one hour, stirring occasionally, till the the grains are soft. Boiling the grains in the broth rather than in water intensifies the meaty flavour of the dish.\n\n**STEP VII—BLENDING EVERYTHING**\n1. Transfer the boiled grains into a blender and grind till everything breaks down. However, be careful not to reduce everything to a uniform, smooth paste, as we want some semblance of texture. Depending on the size of your blender jar, you may have to do this in batches.\n2. Return the _haleem_ to the pan. Add the remaining chunks of meat, along with 650 g hot milk. Mix until uniform. Bring to a boil before turning off the heat.\n\n**STEP VIII—GARNISHING**\n1. For the garnish, julienne some ginger, cut limes into wedges, split green chillies lengthwise, and finely chop the mint leaves.\n2. Drop ladles of the _haleem_ into a serving dish. Top it with a generous amount of _birasta_ and chopped mint leaves.\n3. Heat a pan till it is extremely hot. Add a spoonful of ghee and wait for it to smoke. Then add some julienned ginger and split green chillies. Fry for about 5 seconds and pour the contents of the pan (along with the ghee) over the serving dish.\n\n\n## Served with\n- Bread rolls\n","slug":"khichra-bohra-haleem","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-17T06:35:22.907Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjcles73e001y0wvh22y8phh9","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A slow-cooked stew of meat, grains, and pulses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Of the many migrant communities that make up the rich tapestry of Calcutta’s modern history, the Bohra Muslims might not be the most visible, but they are a thriving culture.

Smear the koi machh with ¾ tsp each of salt and turmeric till they are evenly coated. Set them aside.","2. Cut a cauliflower into chunky florets, about 5 cm large. Take as many florets as there are pieces of fish (in this case, five).","3. Peel and cut the potatoes lengthwise. Again, we need as many pieces of potatoes as there are fish.","4. Chop the tomato into quarters.","5. Heat a kadai till it is completely hot. Drizzle 30 g mustard oil into the pan till it starts smoking lightly, and changes colour from deep to pale yellow.","6. Add all the dal’er bori into the oil and fry them till they are golden. This should take about 15–20 seconds.","7. Remove the fried bori from the pan and set aside.","8. Now, add the cauliflower florets, along with ¼ tsp of salt, to the pan and fry them till they develop a light-brown colour. This should take about 4 minutes in all.","9. Remove the cauliflower from the pan and set aside.","10. Finally, add the marinated koi machh to the same oil, one at a time, and fry them for no longer than a minute on each side. Freshwater fish such as the koi benefit from a light fry, rather than a crusty one. So be sure not to sear the fish too much.","11. Remove the fish from the pan and set aside.","12. You now have fried bori, fried cauliflower, and fried fish ready for use at a later stage, and can now move on to the preparation of the curry.","13. At this point, inspect the oil in your pan. If it looks too burnt, replace it with 10 g of fresh mustard oil. If it is alright, use the same oil to cook the curry in as it contains all the flavour from the fried fish.","14. Temper the oil, set on medium heat, with the bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin seeds, and 2 slit green chillies.","15. Add the potatoes to the pan and fry them, with the lid on, for 4 minutes.","16. While the potatoes are frying, make a paste by combining cumin powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, salt, sugar, and 50 g water.","17. Add this mixture into the pan and fry it, with lid on, till the water dries up.","18. Now, add in the ginger paste and tomatoes, and incorporate them with the spices. Introduce another 50 g water to the pan and sauté the spices again till the water dries off.","19. The key here is to cover and cook because, alongside sautéing the spices, we also want to allow time for the potatoes to become tender.","20. Add in the fried cauliflower florets, fold them into the spices, and cook them for a minute or so.","21. Now, add 350 g of hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.","22. Once it comes to a boil, add in the fried bori, fried fish, and two (more) of the slit green chillies.","23. Using a spoon, gently try and submerge the fish in the curry. Be delicate as the fish is quite fragile at this stage.","24. Cover the pan and allow the curry to simmer for about 6 minutes.","25. Chop fresh coriander and add it to the pan. Let it simmer in the curry for another minute before turning off the heat."]},"_content":"\n\n\n<p class=\"post-byline\">Everyone’s favourite _machh’er jhol_ for the winter months</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">This is a light curry of the climbing perch fish (_koi machh_) and fried cauliflower florets.</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">K</span>_oi machh_ is a delicacy in Bengali cooking. Also known as the climbing perch fish because of its ability _climb_ out of water and walk on land for short distances, _koi machh_ is _always_ bought live at fish markets. It has an extremely slippery exterior, making the use of ash rather necessary while handling the fish for cleaning. Even if the _koi machh_ is scaled, degilled, and cleaned by your fish-seller, it might still be quite slimy to the touch. At home, you may need to rub the fish against an abrasive surface to get rid of the slipperiness (a perforated, steel colander-plate does this job quite well).\n\nComing to this recipe, its main ingredients, _koi machh_ and _phulkopi_ (cauliflower), are fried separately to enhance their flavours, and then added to the delicious _jhol_. The _jhol_ itself is a hot, gingery, _garam-masala_-infused curry that is mildly sweet, but never too spicy. It uplifts the taste of anything it gets soaked up in—potatoes, cauliflower, _bori_, or the fish. Eaten with a generous helping of steaming hot rice, this dish, the _phulkopi diye koi machh’er jhol_ is the Bengali’s favourite fish curry for the winter months.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 40 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|                         Quantity | Ingredient                        |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                             30 g | Mustard oil (for frying)          |\n|                             10 g | Mustard oil (for cooking)         |\n|              350 g (or 5 pieces) | Koi machh (climbing perch fish)   |\n|              150 g (or 5 pieces) | Cauliflower (5-cm florets)        |\n|              100 g (or 5 pieces) | Potatoes (cut lengthwise)         |\n|                        10 pieces | Dal’er bori                       |\n|                             20 g | Tomato (3-cm quarters)                |\n|                            ¼ tsp | Cumin seeds (whole)               |\n|                            2 pcs | Cardamom (whole)                  |\n|                          1 piece | Cinnamon (whole)                  |\n|                          1 piece | Bay leaf                          |\n|                         4 pieces | Green chillies (slit)             |\n|                              7 g | Ginger paste                      |\n|                             15 g | Cumin powder                      |\n|  4 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating) | Turmeric powder                   |\n|                              1 g | Red chilli powder                 |\n| 18 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating) | Salt                              |\n|                             15 g | Sugar                             |\n|                            350 g | Water (hot)                       |\n|                              6 g | Coriander leaves (finely chopped) |\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- Lid for the cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE INGREDIENTS**\n1. Smear the _koi machh_ with ¾ tsp each of salt and turmeric till they are evenly coated. Set them aside.\n2. Cut a cauliflower into chunky florets, about 5 cm large. Take as many florets as there are pieces of fish (in this case, five).\n3. Peel and cut the potatoes lengthwise. Again, we need as many pieces of potatoes as there are fish.\n4. Chop the tomato into 3-cm quarters.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE _BORI_, CAULIFLOWER, AND FISH**\n1. Heat a _kadai_ till it is completely hot. Drizzle 30 g mustard oil into the pan till it starts smoking lightly, and changes colour from deep to pale yellow.\n2. Add all the _dal’er bori_ into the oil and fry them till they are golden. This should take about 15–20 seconds. The bori tend to brown quickly, so stay on the watch.\n3. Remove the fried _bori_ from the pan and set aside.\n4. Now, add the cauliflower florets, along with ¼ tsp of salt, to the pan and fry them till they develop a light-brown colour. This should take about 4 minutes in all.\n5. Remove the cauliflower from the pan and set aside.\n6. Finally, add the marinated _koi machh_ to the same oil, one at a time, and fry them for no longer than a minute on each side. This is a freshwater fish with delicate flavours. So be sure not to sear the fish too long.\n7. Remove the fish from the pan and set aside.\n8. You now have fried _bori_, fried cauliflower, and fried fish ready for use at a later stage, and can now move on to the preparation of the curry.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING THE _JHOL_**\n1. At this point, inspect the oil in your pan. If it looks too burnt, replace it with 10 g of fresh mustard oil. If it is alright, use the same oil to cook the curry in as it contains all the flavour from the fried fish.\n2. Temper the oil, set on medium heat, with the bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin seeds, and 2 slit green chillies.\n3. Add the potatoes to the pan and fry them, with the lid on, for 4 minutes.\n4. While the potatoes are frying, make a paste by combining cumin powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, salt, sugar, and 50 g water.\n5. Add this mixture into the pan and fry it, with lid on, till the water dries up.\n6. Now, add in the ginger paste and the tomatoes, and incorporate them with the spices. Introduce another 50 g water to the pan and sauté the spices again till the water dries off.\n7. The key here is to cover and cook because, alongside sautéing the spices, we also want to allow time for the potatoes to become tender.\n8. Add in the fried cauliflower florets, fold them into the spices, and cook them for a minute or so.\n9. Now, add 350 g of hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n10. Once it comes to a boil, add in the fried _bori_, fried fish, and two (more) of the slit green chillies.\n11. Using a spoon, gently try and submerge the fish in the curry. Be delicate as the fish is quite fragile at this stage.\n12. Cover the pan and allow the curry to simmer for about 6 minutes.\n13. Chop fresh coriander and add it to the pan. Let it simmer in the curry for another minute before turning off the heat.\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n","source":"_posts/koi-machher-jhol-phulkopi-diye.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Koi Machh’er Jhol Phulkopi diye\ndescription: Video recipe for traditional Bengali fish curry made with koi fish simmered in a light gravy along with cauliflowers, bori and potatoes\ntags:\n  - fish\n  - koi machh\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1484875328/website-thumbnail-koi-phulkopi_c0rzir.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: q6q2PZLSOSI\ndate: 2017-01-19 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Koi Machh'er Jhol Phulkopi diye\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1484875490/thumbnail-small-koi-phulkopi_kb0bll.jpg\",\"description\":\"This is a light Bengali fish curry of the climbing perch (_koi machh_) and fried cauliflower florets.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT20M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT40M\",\"recipeYield\":\"5 servings\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"30 g  Mustard oil (for frying)\",\"10 g  Mustard oil (for cooking)\",\"350 g (or 5 pieces)  Koi machh (climbing perch fish)\",\"150 g (or 5 pieces)  Cauliflower (5-cm florets)\",\"100 g (or 5 pieces)  Potatoes (cut lengthwise)\",\"10 pieces  Dal’er bori\",\"20 g  Tomato (3-cm quarters)\",\"¼ tsp  Cumin seeds (whole)\",\"2 pcs  Cardamom (whole)\",\"1 piece  Cinnamon (whole)\",\"1 piece  Bay leaf\",\"4 pieces  Green chillies (slit)\",\"7 g  Ginger paste\",\"15 g  Cumin powder\",\"4 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating)  Turmeric powder\",\"1 g  Red chilli powder\",\"18 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating)  Salt\",\"15 g  Sugar\",\"350 g  Water (hot)\",\"6 g  Coriander leaves (finely chopped)\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

Also known as the climbing perch fish because of its ability <em>climb</em> out of water and walk on land for short distances, <em>koi machh</em> is <em>always</em> bought live at fish markets. It has an extremely slippery exterior, making the use of ash rather necessary while handling the fish for cleaning. Even if the <em>koi machh</em> is scaled, degilled, and cleaned by your fish-seller, it might still be quite slimy to the touch. At home, you may need to rub the fish against an abrasive surface to get rid of the slipperiness (a perforated, steel colander-plate does this job quite well).</p>\n<p>Coming to this recipe, its main ingredients, <em>koi machh</em> and <em>phulkopi</em> (cauliflower), are fried separately to enhance their flavours, and then added to the delicious <em>jhol</em>. The <em>jhol</em> itself is a hot, gingery, <em>garam-masala</em>-infused curry that is mildly sweet, but never too spicy. It uplifts the taste of anything it gets soaked up in—potatoes, cauliflower, <em>bori</em>, or the fish. Eaten with a generous helping of steaming hot rice, this dish, the <em>phulkopi diye koi machh’er jhol</em> is the Bengali’s favourite fish curry for the winter months.<br></p></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 40 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 5 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>30 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil (for frying)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil (for cooking)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>350 g (or 5 pieces)</td>\n<td>Koi machh (climbing perch fish)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>150 g (or 5 pieces)</td>\n<td>Cauliflower (5-cm florets)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g (or 5 pieces)</td>\n<td>Potatoes (cut lengthwise)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 pieces</td>\n<td>Dal’er bori</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 g</td>\n<td>Tomato (3-cm quarters)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Cumin seeds (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 pcs</td>\n<td>Cardamom (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 piece</td>\n<td>Cinnamon (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 piece</td>\n<td>Bay leaf</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 pieces</td>\n<td>Green chillies (slit)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7 g</td>\n<td>Ginger paste</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Cumin powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating)</td>\n<td>Turmeric powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 g</td>\n<td>Red chilli powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating)</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>350 g</td>\n<td>Water (hot)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 g</td>\n<td>Coriander leaves (finely chopped)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Mixing bowl</li>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan</li>\n<li>Lid for the cooking vessel</li>\n<li><em>Khunti</em> | long spatula</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><p><strong>STEP I—PREPPING THE INGREDIENTS</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Smear the <em>koi machh</em> with ¾ tsp each of salt and turmeric till they are evenly coated.

Bitter foods, in particular, are well-known antioxidants that contain immunity-boosting enzymes. In Bengal, these are generally consumed around springtime, when the weather transitions from chilly to hot and all manner of allergens/viruses are in the air. Over the years, Bengali cooks have devised clever and delicious ways to incorporate bitters in their diet—from fried <em>neem</em> leaves to <em>korola bhaja</em> to <em>shukto</em>.</p>\n<p>Today we show you how to prepare <em>korola bhaja</em>—batter-fried rings of bitter gourd—in just 20 minutes. In this recipe, the <em>korola</em> is twice cooked—first steamed and then fried. The batter itself is simple. It is mildly seasoned with some salt, sugar, and green chillies. <em>Nigella seeds</em> provide a subtle fragrance, while <em>posto</em> (poppy) adds crunch. We top it off with a drizzle of raw, pungent mustard oil for crispiness.<br></p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 20 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 4 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>150 g</td>\n<td>Bitter gourd (1-cm rings)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50 g</td>\n<td>Maida (all-purpose flour)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pinch</td>\n<td>Turmeric powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pinch</td>\n<td>Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 g</td>\n<td>Posto (poppy seeds)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 piece</td>\n<td>Green chilli (finely chopped)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>75 g</td>\n<td>Water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>~ 250 g</td>\n<td>Vegetable oil (for deep-frying)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Mixing bowl</li>\n<li>Sauce pan | boiling pot (with lid)</li>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan</li>\n<li>Forks</li>\n<li><em>Jhhajhhri hata</em> | perforated spoon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Divide the <em>korola</em> (bitter gourd) into rings, 1 cm wide.</li>\n<li>Transfer to a saucepan and add hot water, just enough to submerge all the rings.

Bring a pot of water to a boil.\n2. Lower the eggs (which should be at room temperature; eggs from the refrigerator might crack when added to boiling water) in the water and cook them on low heat for 6 minutes (duck eggs) or 5 minutes (chicken eggs), with the lid on.\n3. Turn off the heat and let the eggs sit in the hot water for another 3 minutes. We want the yolks gooey.\n4. Drain the water and remove the shells.\n5. Prick the eggs all around with a toothpick. This will prevent the eggs from bursting when fried and also allow the gravy to seep to the yolk.\n6. Coat the eggs in ¼ tsp each of salt and turmeric powder.\n7. Fry the eggs in 10 g mustard oil on medium heat for 5 minutes, till they develop an even amber-coloured crust.\n8. Set aside.\n\n  **PART II—BOILING THE POTATOES**\n1. Peel and cut the potatoes in chunks of 5 cm. We need as many pieces of potatoes as there are eggs (four, in this case).\n2. Place them in a microwaveable bowl with 6 g of salt and 2 tablespoons of water.\n3. Cover with cling film and microwave for 3 minutes. Alternatively, you can also boil them on the stove till partially cooked.\n4. Set aside.\n\n  **PART III—PREPARING THE CURRY**\n1. Now, heat 20 g mustard oil in a pan.\n2. Temper the oil with the _phoron_ (dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds).\n3. Once the whole spices start to crackle in oil, add the chopped onions and sugar to the pan and fry on medium heat for 5–7 minutes.\n4. Add the ginger paste and minced garlic to the pan, and fry for another 3–4 minutes.\n5. Make a spice paste by adding 50 g water to the cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and salt.\n6. Add this mixture to the pan and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n7. Then, add another 50g of water, along with the tomatoes and green chilli, and cook till the water dries off again.\n8. Add the parboiled potatoes and cook on low heat for 2 minutes.\n9. Then add the eggs. Cook for another minute. Stop here if you want _dim’er kosha_, a rich gravy to accompany your fried rice or _luchi_. For a lighter curry to eat with steamed rice, proceed to the next step.\n10. Now, add 225 g hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n11. Boil for 5–7 minutes with the lid on before removing from the heat.\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Steamed rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- Fried rice\n- Luchi\n","source":"_posts/dimer-dalna.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Dim’er Dalna or Duck Egg Curry\ndescription: The ultimate Bengali egg curry made with duck eggs-boiled, fried golden, then cooked in onion-garlic-ginger-tomato-garam masala sauce.\ntags:\n  - dalna\n  - curry\n  - egg\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1488865263/dimer-dalna-website_xexmyd.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: bMuoNOjW4Wc\ndate: 2016-07-28 21:39:47\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Dim'er dalna\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1488865263/dimer-dalna-website_xexmyd.jpg\",\"description\":\"This is a hearty, filling curry.

Bring a pot of water to a boil.\n2. Lower the eggs (which should be at room temperature; eggs from the refrigerator might crack when added to boiling water) in the water and cook them on low heat for 6 minutes (duck eggs) or 5 minutes (chicken eggs), with the lid on.\n3. Turn off the heat and let the eggs sit in the hot water for another 3 minutes. We want the yolks gooey.\n4. Drain the water and remove the shells.\n5. Prick the eggs all around with a toothpick. This will prevent the eggs from bursting when fried and also allow the gravy to seep to the yolk.\n6. Coat the eggs in ¼ tsp each of salt and turmeric powder.\n7. Fry the eggs in 10 g mustard oil on medium heat for 5 minutes, till they develop an even amber-coloured crust.\n8. Set aside.\n\n  **PART II—BOILING THE POTATOES**\n1. Peel and cut the potatoes in chunks of 5 cm. We need as many pieces of potatoes as there are eggs (four, in this case).\n2. Place them in a microwaveable bowl with 6 g of salt and 2 tablespoons of water.\n3. Cover with cling film and microwave for 3 minutes. Alternatively, you can also boil them on the stove till partially cooked.\n4. Set aside.\n\n  **PART III—PREPARING THE CURRY**\n1. Now, heat 20 g mustard oil in a pan.\n2. Temper the oil with the _phoron_ (dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds).\n3. Once the whole spices start to crackle in oil, add the chopped onions and sugar to the pan and fry on medium heat for 5–7 minutes.\n4. Add the ginger paste and minced garlic to the pan, and fry for another 3–4 minutes.\n5. Make a spice paste by adding 50 g water to the cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and salt.\n6. Add this mixture to the pan and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n7. Then, add another 50g of water, along with the tomatoes and green chilli, and cook till the water dries off again.\n8. Add the parboiled potatoes and cook on low heat for 2 minutes.\n9. Then add the eggs. Cook for another minute. Stop here if you want _dim’er kosha_, a rich gravy to accompany your fried rice or _luchi_. For a lighter curry to eat with steamed rice, proceed to the next step.\n10. Now, add 225 g hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n11. Boil for 5–7 minutes with the lid on before removing from the heat.\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Steamed rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- Fried rice\n- Luchi\n","slug":"dimer-dalna","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-30T02:31:02.105Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjcles73o00280wvhtpi30yzy","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A spicy egg curry</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">This is one of those rare dishes that manages to be decadent and comforting at the same time</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">E</span>very part of India has its own iteration of the egg curry.

For the outer paratha/wrap, add the flour, salt, sugar, and dalda to a mixing bowl. Combine the ingredients until the fat is well dispersed in the flour. Take your time and rub the flour between your fingers until it resembles breadcrumbs in texture. This will lead to a flakier crust.","2. Now add the warm water and knead the dough for about 5 minutes until it is soft and smooth. Coat it with oil, cover the bowl, and allow it to rest for 30 minutes.","3. Meanwhile, mix together finely sliced onions, chopped green chillies and the juice of half a lime. Pickling the onions in lime juice reduces their sharpness. If using cucumber, peel it and remove the central seeds. Then chop them into thin matchsticks. Create an assembly station where you gather all the items required for the filling. This will allow you to easily put together the roll once the paratha is off the stove.","4. Back to the dough: once it has rested, divide it in 130 g portions. For an extra-flaky exterior, we will roll the dough in the lachcha paratha style, incorporating layers of flour and oil. To do this, form a ball and roll it out to a disc about 12 cm large. Apply a thin layer of oil on the surface and sprinkle some dry flour. Make an incision on the disc along a radius and roll it in the shape of a cone [WATCH THE VIDEO]. Press down to flatten. Rest the dough for about 5 minutes to relax it again, after which roll it for a second time to disc 22 cm in diameter.","5. Beat an egg with a pinch of salt and keep at the ready.","6. Heat about 4 tsp oil (12 g) in a flat frying pan or skillet. Add the paratha and fry it on both sides until golden. Rotate the paratha continuously, flipping often, for a uniform crust. Pay special attention to the sides to ensure that they crisp too. Once the paratha is completely cooked, spread the beaten egg over it. Before it settles, turn over to fry the side with the egg. Transfer it to the assembly station, with the egg side facing up.","7. Sprinkle it with chaat masala and rocksalt. Add a row of the pickled onions a little off the centre of the paratha. Squeeze some lime juice over it. Top it with cucumber if you like. One of our favourite variations of the egg roll is the egg-potato roll. If we have it on hand, we like to add some leftover spicy alu’r torkari as well. Finish everything off with a few squirts of ketchup.","8. Form a tight roll, making sure the filling is all enclosed within the paratha. Wrap a paper around two-thirds of the roll and tuck any excess at the bottom."]},"_content":"\n\n\n\n<p class=\"post-byline\">Calcutta's most popular and iconic street food</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Of all the rolls, wraps, and frankies we have had, nothing comes close to a Calcutta roll—neither in taste, nor in sound architecture.</p>\n\n[_In this series, we tip our hats to some of our favourite dishes available in the restaurants, cafés, and cabins of Calcutta.

The outer shell, the _paratha_ itself, must be flaky yet soft. It should not be too chewy, that is to say, you should not have to tug at it with your teeth.

For the outer _paratha_/wrap, add the flour, salt, sugar, and _dalda_ to a mixing bowl. Combine the ingredients until the fat is well dispersed in the flour. Take your time and rub the flour between your fingers until it resembles breadcrumbs in texture. This will lead to a flakier crust.\n2. Now add the warm water and knead the dough for about 5 minutes until it is soft and smooth. Coat it with oil, cover the bowl, and allow it to rest for 30 minutes.\n3. Meanwhile, mix together finely sliced onions, chopped green chillies and the juice of half a lime. Pickling the onions in lime juice reduces their sharpness. If using cucumber, peel it and remove the central seeds. Then chop them into thin matchsticks. Create an assembly station where you gather all the items required for the filling. This will allow you to easily put together the roll once the _paratha_ is off the stove.\n4. Back to the dough: once it has rested, divide it in 130 g portions. For an extra-flaky exterior, we will roll the dough in the _lachcha paratha_ style, incorporating layers of flour and oil. To do this, form a ball and roll it out to a disc about 12 cm large. Apply a thin layer of oil on the surface and sprinkle some dry flour. Make an incision on the disc along a radius and roll it in the shape of a cone [WATCH THE VIDEO]. Press down to flatten. Rest the dough for about 5 minutes to relax it again, after which roll it for a second time to disc 22 cm in diameter.\n5. Beat an egg with a pinch of salt and keep at the ready.\n6. Heat about 4 tsp oil (12 g) in a flat frying pan or skillet. Add the _paratha_ and fry it on both sides until golden. Rotate the _paratha_ continuously, flipping often, for a uniform crust. Pay special attention to the sides to ensure that they crisp too. Once the _paratha_ is completely cooked, spread the beaten egg over it. Before it settles, turn over to fry the side with the egg. Transfer it to the assembly station, with the egg side facing up.\n7. Sprinkle it with _chaat masala_ and rocksalt. Add a row of the pickled onions a little off the centre of the _paratha_. Squeeze some lime juice over it. Top it with cucumber if you like. One of our favourite variations of the egg roll is the egg-potato roll. If we have it on hand, we like to add some leftover spicy _alu’r torkari_ as well. Finish everything off with a few squirts of ketchup.\n8. Form a tight roll, making sure the filling is all enclosed within the _paratha_. Wrap a paper around two-thirds of the roll and tuck any excess at the bottom.\n\n\n## Served with\n- Green chillies\n- Lime wedges\n- [Thums up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thums_Up)!","source":"_posts/kolkata-egg-roll.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Calcutta Egg Rolls\ntags:\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - street food\n  - Calcutta-style food\n  - snack\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1504209714/egg-roll-website_-thumbnail-_h4tzx1.png\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: 84iZjEzqpRE\ndate: 2017-08-31 20:30:00\ndescription: The iconic Calcutta egg roll, ladies and gents!

Times may not be so tough, but the fact that we still actively seek out and prepare such dishes is testament to the sheer genius of our foremothers.<br></p></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 20 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 5 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>175 g</td>\n<td>Peels of lau (bottle gourd)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil (for frying)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 piece</td>\n<td>Dried red chilli</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 piece</td>\n<td>Bay leaf</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 pieces</td>\n<td>Dal’er bori</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 g</td>\n<td>Grated coconut</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 piece</td>\n<td>Green chilli (slit)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Turmeric powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 g</td>\n<td>Coriander leaves (finely chopped)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan</li>\n<li><em>Khunti</em> | long spatula</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n<li>Grater | grinder</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Wash the <em>lau</em> (bottle gourd) and divide it up in sections of 6 cm width.</li>\n<li>Now, using a sharp knife, start peeling the <em>lau</em>, keeping the peels as thin as possible, but making sure not to break them.</li>\n<li>Reserve the vegetable for use in another dish; for this recipe, we just need the peels.</li>\n<li>Take each peel, one by one, and start cutting it in 2mm-wide strips.

It is usually served as an appetiser for lunch, just after <em>shaak</em> (greens) and before <em>dal</em> (lentils). It opens up the palate for the oncoming spicier courses. While the most popular <em>shukto</em> is the one made from a selection of vegetables—such as <em>kachkola</em> (raw bananas), <em>sheem</em> (flat beans), sweet potatoes, brinjal, <em>korola</em> (bitter gourd), and so on—the one we show you here is made of just <em>lau</em> or bottle gourd.

Then bunch up about 3–4 of the slices at a time, and further cut them into matchsticks, 3 mm wide.</li>\n<li>In a small bowl, make a paste by mixing the ginger, turmeric, cumin powder, and 25 g water. Set aside.</li>\n<li>In a pan set on medium flame, add the <em>moong dal</em>.</li>\n<li>Dry-roast the <em>dal</em>, stirring continuously, till it changes colour to a pinkish-brown. This should take about 4 minutes.</li>\n<li>Once the <em>dal</em> is roasted, remove it from the pan, and set aside for later.</li>\n<li>To the same pan set on medium heat, add 15 g mustard oil.</li>\n<li>Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, add in the <em>dal’er bori</em>.</li>\n<li>Fry the <em>boris</em> till they turn golden.

You may add an additional 25 g water to the pan if the spices turn dry and start to stick to the bottom of the pan.</li>\n<li>Once the spices have fried, add in the roasted <em>moong dal</em> and cook everything for 2 minutes.</li>\n<li>Then add all the shredded <em>lau</em>, along with the salt. Mix till the vegetable is coated with the spices.</li>\n<li>Cover the pan and let the <em>lau</em> steam for a good 20 minutes. During this time, the salt will help draw the moisture from the gourd and soften it. Don’t forget to stir occasionally to ensure that the <em>lau</em> doesn’t stick to the pan.</li>\n<li>Once the gourd is soft, add the sugar and slit green chillies. Cover and cook for another 8 minutes.</li>\n<li>Break the fried <em>bori</em> into shards and add them to the pan, along with freshly chopped coriander leaves.

And we won't lie, it does require a fair bit of planning. But for the _mughlai porota_ aficionado, the pay-offs are enormous!</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">M</span>_ughlai porota_ is essentially a flaky flour pastry, filled with a mixture of beaten eggs, _keema_, spices, and seasoning. It differs from other stuffed _porotas_ in that filling cooks inside the _porota_, and that it is layered.\n\n_Mughlai porota_ can be made at home with a little bit of organisation. Plan for the following elements individually, and in this order:</p>\n1. **The _keema_**—This is an important component of the filling. We like to use cooked mutton or beef _keema_ (minced meat sautéed with onions, ginger, garlic, green chillies, turmeric, and _garam masala_). It needs to be prepared in advance.\n2. **The dough**—This will form the pastry within which the filling is enclosed. Be sure to knead the flour and set it to rest for at least 30 minutes.\n3. **The filling**—While your dough is resting, use this time to chop the onions, green chillies, ginger, and fresh coriander. Toast some peanuts and roughly crush them. Get the bread crumbs and salt out. Beat an egg in a bowl along with all the ingredients and your filling is ready to go!\n4. **The sides**—_Mughlai porota_ is served with a cabin-style salad of cucumber, onion, and beet, _alu'r torkari_, chicken or mutton _kosha_, and some ketchup. If you want some or all of these sides, be sure to prepare them before your start making the _mughlai_.\n5. **The _Mughlai porota_**—Now that the filling has been prepared, the sides are organised, and the dough has had time to rest, we are ready to bring all these elements together. See below for the full recipe.\n\n**COOKING TIME** 60 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 1 _mughlai porota_\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n**FOR THE POROTA/PASTRY**\n\n| Quantity | Ingredient                            |\n|----------|---------------------------------------|\n|     75 g | Flour                                 |\n|      1 g | Salt                                  |\n|      1 g | Sugar                                 |\n|      5 g | Oil                                   |\n|     40 g | Warm water                                 |\n\n**FOR THE FILLING**\n\n| Quantity | Ingredient                            |\n|----------|---------------------------------------|\n|  1 piece | Egg (beaten)                          |\n|     20 g | Keema (cooked mutton or beef keema)   |\n|     10 g | Onions (finely diced)                 |\n|      2 g | Green chillies (finely chopped)       |\n|      2 g | Ginger (finely diced)                 |\n|      3 g | Coriander (finely chopped)            |\n|      5 g | Peanuts (toasted and roughly chopped) |\n|     10 g | Bread crumbs                          |\n|      2 g | Salt                                  |\n|  ~300 ml | Oil for frying                        |\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl or dish\n- Rolling pin | large rolling surface\n- Frying pan\n- Frying spoon | _jhanjhri_\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**PART I—KNEADING THE DOUGH**\n1.

It differs from other stuffed _porotas_ in that filling cooks inside the _porota_, and that it is layered.\n\n_Mughlai porota_ can be made at home with a little bit of organisation. Plan for the following elements individually, and in this order:</p>\n1. **The _keema_**—This is an important component of the filling. We like to use cooked mutton or beef _keema_ (minced meat sautéed with onions, ginger, garlic, green chillies, turmeric, and _garam masala_). It needs to be prepared in advance.\n2. **The dough**—This will form the pastry within which the filling is enclosed. Be sure to knead the flour and set it to rest for at least 30 minutes.\n3. **The filling**—While your dough is resting, use this time to chop the onions, green chillies, ginger, and fresh coriander. Toast some peanuts and roughly crush them. Get the bread crumbs and salt out. Beat an egg in a bowl along with all the ingredients and your filling is ready to go!\n4. **The sides**—_Mughlai porota_ is served with a cabin-style salad of cucumber, onion, and beet, _alu'r torkari_, chicken or mutton _kosha_, and some ketchup. If you want some or all of these sides, be sure to prepare them before your start making the _mughlai_.\n5. **The _Mughlai porota_**—Now that the filling has been prepared, the sides are organised, and the dough has had time to rest, we are ready to bring all these elements together.

Take 1 kg milk in a heavy-bottom saucepan and set it to boil.","2. Once bubbling, stir in 45 g sugar.","3. Keep boiling the milk, while stirring it continuously, for about 90 minutes.","4. During this entire time, the pot should be on medium to low heat.","5. At regular intervals of 3–4 minutes, scrape the solids from the bottom and sides of the pot, and incorporate them into the boiling milk. This step, as well as the previous one, is crucial. We don’t want our kheer to burn at any point.","6. Once the milk has reduced and thickened (when you lift some of it on your spoon and drop it, it should falls in clumps), make a paste of ¾ tsp flour and 1 tbsp milk.","7. Add this paste to the pot. Stir and cook for another 5 minutes.","8. Divide the kheer into 10 portions of 20 g each.","9. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least two hours.","10. In a mixing bowl, take 200 g flour, 40 g ghee, and 4 g salt. Mix these ingredients well till they take on a bread-crumb texture. The idea is to distribute the fat among the flour particles, in order to make the pastry crisp and flaky.","11. Now, add in 80 g water.","12. Mix until the dough comes together. This is a tight dough, so don’t add more water even if it seems a bit dry at first.","13. Cover the dough and rest it for at least 20 minutes.","14. Once the kheer has chilled in the fridge for at least 2 hours, and the pastry dough is rested for at least 20 minutes, proceed to shaping each of them.","15. Shape each 20 g portion of kheer into 3 cm by 4 cm tablets. Put them back in the fridge to chill, till needed.","16. Divide the dough in 10 portions of 30 g each.","17. Shape each portion into a flat disc. Cover and rest, till needed.","18. This proportion—20 g kheer and 30 g dough—will give you the best filling to pastry ratio.","19. Roll each portion of the dough into a 14 cm disc, about 1 mm thick.","20. Place a kheer tablet at the centre of the disc.","21. With your fingertips, apply water to the edges of the rolled pastry. This will act as a glue.","22. Fold the opposite ends over one another, overlapping them. Press gently to seal.","23. Turn the pastry over and apply water to the protruding wings. Fold them over each other, sealing them as you go.","24. Use a clove to seal the topmost layer of the envelope in place.","25. Follow these steps for all the pastries.","26. In a saucepan, add 400 g sugar and 200 g water.","27. Cover with a lid, and set it on medium heat for about 10 minutes, or till the sugar syrup starts bubbling.","28. For this recipe, we do not want a thick syrup. It should be the consistency of, say, packaged fruit juice.","29. Heat oil in a frying pan to 150°C. The oil should be 5-cm deep.","30. Lobongo lotika is not fried in hot oil like other deep-fried snacks or crisps. Since this pastry has a lot of layers of flour, we must fry it at low temperatures to ensure that all the layers cook through. If you try to fry it at a high temperature, the outside may look brown and done, but the inner layers will still be gummy.","31.

Take 1 kg milk in a heavy-bottom saucepan and set it to boil.\n2. Once bubbling, stir in 45 g sugar.\n3. Keep boiling the milk, while stirring it continuously, for about 90 minutes.\n4. During this entire time, the pot should be on medium to low heat.\n5. At regular intervals of 3–4 minutes, scrape the solids from the bottom and sides of the pot, and incorporate them into the boiling milk. This step, as well as the previous one, is crucial. We don’t want our _kheer_ to burn at any point.\n6. Once the milk has reduced and thickened (when you lift some of it on your spoon and drop it, it should falls in clumps), make a paste of ¾ tsp flour and 1 tbsp milk.\n7. Add this paste to the pot. Stir and cook for another 5 minutes.\n8. Divide the _kheer_ into 10 portions of 20 g each.\n9. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least two hours.\n\n**STEP II—THE PASTRY DOUGH**\n1. In a mixing bowl, take 200 g flour, 40 g _ghee_, and 4 g salt. Mix these ingredients well till they take on a bread-crumb texture. The idea is to distribute the fat among the flour particles, in order to make the pastry crisp and flaky.\n2. Now, add in 80 g water.\n3. Mix until the dough comes together. This is a tight dough, so don’t add more water even if it seems a bit dry at first.\n4. Cover the dough and rest it for at least 20 minutes.\n\n**STEP III—SHAPING**\n1. Once the _kheer_ has chilled in the fridge for at least 2 hours, and the pastry dough is rested for at least 20 minutes, proceed to shaping each of them.\n2. Shape each 20 g portion of _kheer_ into 3 cm by 4 cm tablets. Put them back in the fridge to chill, till needed.\n3. Divide the dough in 10 portions of 30 g each.\n4. Shape each portion into a flat disc. Cover and rest, till needed.\n5. This proportion—20 g _kheer_ and 30 g dough—will give you the best filling to pastry ratio.\n\n**STEP IV—CONSTRUCTION**\n1. Roll each portion of the dough into a 14 cm disc, about 1 mm thick.\n2. Place a _kheer_ tablet at the centre of the disc.\n3. With your fingertips, apply water to the edges of the rolled pastry. This will act as a glue.\n4. Fold the opposite ends over one another, overlapping them. Press gently to seal.\n5. Turn the pastry over and apply water to the protruding wings. Fold them over each other, sealing them as you go.\n6. Use a clove to seal the topmost layer of the envelope in place.\n7. Follow these steps for all the pastries.\n\n**STEP V—THE SUGAR SYRUP**\n1. In a saucepan, add 400 g sugar and 200 g water.\n2. Cover with a lid, and set it on medium heat for about 10 minutes, or till the sugar syrup starts bubbling.\n3. For this recipe, we do not want a thick syrup. It should be the consistency of, say, packaged fruit juice.\n\n **STEP VI—THE SUGAR SYRUP**\n1. Heat oil in a frying pan to 150°C. The oil should be 5-cm deep.\n2. **_Lobongo lotika_ is not fried in hot oil like other deep-fried snacks or crisps. Since this pastry has a lot of layers of flour, we must fry it at low temperatures to ensure that all the layers cook through. If you try to fry it at a high temperature, the outside may look brown and done, but the inner layers will still be gummy.**\n3. Because of the slow frying, each batch of _lobongo lotika_ will take about 30 minutes to cook completely.  \n4. During this period, **turn them every five minutes** to ensure that the dough is getting cooked, and hardening, from both sides evenly. Otherwise, the _kheer_ may start to ooze out of the softer end.\n5. In case the filling leaks into the oil, you may remove the damaged pastry from the oil and put it inside an oven at 175°C for about 20 minutes.\n6. Once the pastries are golden-brown in colour, drain them from the oil and dunk them in the sugar syrup. Coat well, shake off the excess syrup, and place them on a plate to cool.  \n\n## Served with\n- Tea\n","source":"_posts/lobongo-lotika.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Lobongo Lotika\ntags:\n  - vegetarian\n  - snack\n  - sweets\ndescription: >-\n  Lobongo lotika is a flaky parcel, filled with kheer (sweetened, reduced milk), sealed with a clove, deep fried, and coated with sugar syrup.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1491526895/lobongo-lotika-website-thumbnail-_casq91.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: 7FiVDkUjkF4\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Lobongo Lotika\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1491526895/lobongo-lotika-website-thumbnail-_casq91.jpg\",\"description\":\"Lobongo lotika is a flaky parcel, filled with kheer (sweetened, reduced milk), sealed with a clove, deep fried, and coated with sugar syrup.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT30M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT180M\",\"recipeYield\":\"10 pieces\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"Whole milk 1 kg\",\"Sugar 445 g\",\"Water 280 g\",\"Maida (flour) 200 g\",\"Ghee 40 g\",\"Salt 4 g\",\"Vegetable oil (for deep frying) ~ 400 g\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

Like the <em>mishti singara</em>, it is also filled with <em>kheer</em>. But what gives <em>lobongo lotika</em> its whimsically poetic name is the fact that the <em>kheer</em> envelopes, once folded, are sealed with a single clove (<em>lobongo</em>).</p>\n<p>This recipe calls for only six ingredients, all of which you undoubtedly have on hand.

Coat all the mutton pieces with the marinade, making sure to get into all the nooks and crannies of the meat. Cover and allow the mutton to marinate in the refrigerator for about 8 hours. \n3. Coming to the prep: Cut 400 g onions into thin slices. For this recipe, sliced onions define the texture of the curry. Diced, chopped, or puréed onions won’t give you the same result. Using a mortar and pestle, crush together 10 g garlic and 20 g green chillies to a paste. For ease while stirring later on, you may also cut all the bay leaves in 3-cm sections using a pair of scissors.\n4. Heat a large _kadai_ and add mustard oil to it. Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, add the dried red chillies, bay leaves, cinnamon, green cardamom, black cardamom, and cloves. \n5. Add the onions and fry them on medium flame for about 15 minutes until they are light brown in colour. Then, add the ginger paste, and garlic and green chilli paste, and fry for another 5 minutes. Keep the flame medium to low, depending on whether your onions are sticking to the pan or not, and stir often. We want to fry the spices as well as develop colour on the onions.

Mutton <em>kosha</em> (or <em>kosha mangsho</em>) can be served with <em>porota</em> or <em>polao</em>. It tastes great even with plain rice. One of the most famous shops selling this style of mutton <em>kosha</em> is Golbari at the Shyambazar crossing in Calcutta. While we are not certain that our version is exactly like Golbari’s, we can assure you it certainly tastes very good.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 1.5 to 2 hours<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 6 servings<br><strong>calories</strong> 560 kcal per serving</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1 kg</td>\n<td>Mutton</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR THE MARINADE</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g</td>\n<td>Onion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Garlic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g</td>\n<td>Yoghurt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Turmeric powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 g</td>\n<td>Shahi garam masala powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR THE CURRY</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 cm</td>\n<td>Cinnamon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 pcs</td>\n<td>Green cardamom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pc</td>\n<td>Black cardamom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 pcs</td>\n<td>Cloves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 pcs</td>\n<td>Dried red chillies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 pcs</td>\n<td>Bay leaves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>400 g</td>\n<td>Onions (sliced)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>40 g</td>\n<td>Ginger paste</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Garlic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 g</td>\n<td>Green chillies (plus 4 extra pieces for garnish)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 g</td>\n<td>Coriander powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 g</td>\n<td>Cumin powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 g</td>\n<td>Kashmiri red chilli powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>150–200 g</td>\n<td>Yoghurt (based on how tart you want your curry)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>~1 litre</td>\n<td>Hot water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Ghee</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Mixing bowl</li>\n<li>Mortar and pestle</li>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan with lid</li>\n<li><em>Khunti</em> | long spatula</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n<li>Grinder</li>\n<li>Electric kettle (optional)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>For the marinade, add 100 g quartered onions, 5 g roughly chopped garlic, 100 g yoghurt, 15 g salt, turmeric, and shahi garam masala to a grinder jar.

In many cases, the choice of _phoron_ defines the flavour profile of the recipe (think of a dish like [_panchmishali torkari_](/recipe/panchmishali-torkari/), or a fish curry like _tel jhol_).

If you can’t find _radhuni_ where you live, cumin seeds make an acceptable substitute.\n\nThe _panch phoron_ is used like any other _phoron_. You heat up the mustard oil thoroughly, till it starts to smoke lightly and turns pale yellow in colour. You then add as much _panch phoron_ as the recipe calls for to the oil. The spices will start cracking immediately (mostly because of the mustard seeds in the mix) and give out a distinctive, bitter-sweet-anisey aroma. However, watch the _methi_ in the mix carefully; it tends to redden, burn quite easily, and turn bitter.

However, you need to keep boiling it until you reach a stage where a grain mashed between your fingers faces no resistance at all. It should be mushy soft, as rice will harden when payesh is cooled. Stir gently throughout this process. Not only will that ensure that the payesh doesn’t burn, stirring will also release the starch from the rice, which will help thicken the payesh.</li>\n<li>Now is it is time to add the gur. But you need to be sure of two things before that.<br>(a) The rice should be fully cooked because after adding the gur, the rice will not cook any further.<br>(b) The payesh should be slightly thicker than how you actually want it as gur will loosen it up slightly. Right. Now <em>turn off the heat</em> and  add the gur, along with salt, soaked raisins, and fried cashew. Keep <em>heat turned off</em> as any impurities in the gur will cause the milk to split. Fold everything in and cover the pan. Allow the residual heat to melt the gur fully. Serve hot or cool. </li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Served-with\"><a href=\"#Served-with\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Served with\"></a>Served with</h2><ul>\n<li><a href=\"/recipe/luchi/\">Luchi</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"title":"Niramish Alu’r Dom","description":"Bengali-style juicy curried new baby potatoes cooked in a savoury, tangy sauce and sprinkled with green peas.","thumbnailImagePosition":"top","thumbnailImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1514495536/alur-dom-website-thumbnail-_qzvq9f.png","coverMeta":"out","coverSize":"partial","videoId":"lgKT3avl8j0","date":"2017-12-28T17:00:00.000Z","jsonLd":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Recipe","name":"Niramish Aloo Dum","author":"Bong Eats","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1514495536/alur-dom-website-thumbnail-_qzvq9f.png","description":"Bengali-style juicy curried new baby potatoes cooked in a savoury, tangy sauce and sprinkled with green peas.","prepTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT45M","recipeYield":"6 servings","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"6","calories":"187 calories"},"recipeIngredient":["700 g New baby potatoes (notun alu)","50 g Peas (blanched)","30 g Mustard oil","2 pcs Dried red chillies","2 pcs Bay leaves","3 pcs Cloves","2 pcs Cardamom","1 pc Cinnamon","½ tsp Cumin seeds","¼ tsp Hing (asafoetida)","½ tsp Turmeric","½ tsp Kashmiri red chilli powder","1 tsp Cumin powder","1½ tsp Coriander powder","½ tsp Amchur (dried mango powder)","¼ tsp Beetnoon (black salt)","15 g Ginger paste","6 g Green chilli paste","50 g Yoghurt","20 g Tomato ketchup","20 g Cashewnuts (ground)","½ tsp Kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)","45 g Total salt","18 g Sugar","¼ tsp Bengali garam masala powder","5 g Ghee"],"recipeInstructions":["1.

Prepared in Bengal during the winter months using the newly harvested baby potatoes or ‘notun alu’, alu’r dom is best enjoyed with luchi, koraishuti’r kochuri, polao, fried rice, or porota. This simple recipe is for the _niramish_ (vegetarian) version, which, in Bengali cuisine means it makes no use of onion or garlic. It can, therefore, be served as bhog. \n</p>\n\nThe key to a good alu’r dom is perfectly tender and uniformly salted potatoes, because who enjoys under-seasoned spuds? In this recipe, the baby potatoes are twice boiled—first in heavily salted water (with skin on) and then again in the curry—for a total of nearly one hour. ‘Notun alu’ are notorious in that they don’t allow salt and spices to penetrate easily. They must, therefore, be cooked longer than one would normally cook potatoes.\n\nThis is not a strictly traditional version of the Bengali niramish alu’r dom, but our take on this classic and well-loved recipe. It produces juicy alu’r dom with a rich, dry gravy, ready to be mopped up with a piece of light, fluffy luchi. \n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 75 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 6 servings\n**CALORIES** 187 kcal\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                            | \n|----------|---------------------------------------|\n|    700 g | New baby potatoes (notun alu)         |\n|     50 g | Peas (blanched)                       |\n|     30 g | Mustard oil                           |\n|    2 pcs | Dried red chillies                    |\n|    2 pcs | Bay leaves                            |\n|    3 pcs | Cloves                                |\n|    2 pcs | Cardamom                              |\n|     1 pc | Cinnamon                              |\n|    ½ tsp | Cumin seeds                           |\n|    ¼ tsp | Hing (asafoetida)                     |\n|    ½ tsp | Turmeric                              |\n|    ½ tsp | Kashmiri red chilli powder            |\n|    1 tsp | Cumin powder                          |\n|  1½ tsp  | Coriander powder                      |\n|    ½ tsp | Amchur (dried mango powder)           |\n|    ¼ tsp | Beetnoon (black salt)                 |\n|     15 g | Ginger paste                          |\n|      6 g | Green chilli paste                    |\n|     50 g | Yoghurt                               |\n|     20 g | Tomato ketchup                        |\n|     20 g | Cashewnuts (ground)                   |\n|    ½ tsp | Kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) |\n|     45 g | Total salt                            |\n|     18 g | Sugar                                 |\n|    ¼ tsp | [Bengali garam masala powder](/recipe/bengali-garam-masala/)           |\n|      5 g | Ghee                                  |\n|    400 g | Hot water (for the gravy)             |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot with lid\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n-  _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Grinder\n- Mortar and pestle\n\n\n## Method\n1.

It is sweet to the taste, flaky, and delicately flavoured. To top it all off, it is also extremely easy to eat, as it contains no bones besides the central skeleton. This recipe, _pabda machh’er tel jhol_, is a delicacy in Bengali cooking. ‘_Tel jhol_’ is the name given to a light curry, which is infused with _kaalo jeere_, green chillies, and mustard oil. Because it is sparsely spiced, this style of curry doesn’t overpower the star ingredient—the fish—but lets it shine on its own. If you have managed to procure a batch of fresh _pabda_, this should be your go-to _jhol_.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 30 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|                               Quantity | Ingredient                        |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                                  450 g | Pabda machh (cut and cleaned)     |\n|                                   35 g | Mustard oil (for frying)          |\n|                                    7 g | Mustard oil (for cooking)         |\n|                                    7 g | Mustard oil (for garnish)         |\n|                                ¼ tsp   | Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)       |\n|                               5 pieces | Green chillies (slit)             |\n|                                   25 g | Tomato (roughly chopped)          |\n|                              10 pieces | Dal’er bori                       |\n|                                  100 g | Brinjal (5-cm segments)           |\n| 15 g (plus ¾ tsp extra for marinating) | Salt                              |\n|  6 g (plus ¾ tsp extra for marinating) | Turmeric powder                   |\n|                                  ½ tsp | Atta (flour)                      |\n|                                    8 g | Coriander leaves (finely chopped) |\n|                                  400 g | Warm water                        |\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Electric kettle (optional)\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE INGREDIENTS**\n1. Smear the cut and cleaned _padba machh_ with ¾ tsp turmeric powder, ¾ tsp salt, and 1 tsp mustard oil. Mix till the fish are well coated, and set aside.\n2. Cut the brinjal into 5-cm segments. We need as many pieces of brinjal as there are fish—in this case, five.\n3. Roughly chop the tomatoes.\n4. Slit the green chillies.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE _BORI_, BRINJAL, AND FISH**\n1. Heat your _kadai_ well and add 35 g mustard oil to the pan.\n2. Once the oil is completely hot (that is, once it has begun to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow), add the _dal’er bori_.\n3. Fry the _boris_ for about 20 seconds till they are golden brown. They colour very quickly, so be alert while frying them.\n4. Remove the _boris_ from the oil and set aside.\n5. Next, add the brinjal pieces to the oil.\n6. Stir-fry for about 4 minutes till they are golden. Remove them from the oil and set aside.\n7. Now, in batches, fry the marinated fish. Fresh, sweetwater fish such as the _pabda_ do not need heavy searing. Fry them lightly to preserve their delicate flavour. A minute on each side should do the job.\n8. Remove the fried fish on a plate and reserve for later use.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING THE _JHOL_**\n1. Before we start, make a paste with 15 g salt, 6 g turmeric powder, and 50 g water. Mix and keep ready.\n2. Heat 7 g mustard oil in the _kadai_. (If the oil that you fried the fish in is not burnt, you may use the same oil to prepare the _jhol_.)\n3. Add the _kaalo jeere_, tomatoes, and 3 green chillies to the oil.\n4. Fry them for a minute on medium heat.\n5. Add the turmeric and salt mixture to the pan, and fry till the water in the spice mix dries up.\n6. Now, pour 400 g of hot water (either heated in an electric kettle or on the stove) into the pan. This will form the curry.\n7. Once the curry starts to simmer, add in the fried _boris_.\n8. Simmer for another 2 minutes before lowering in the _pabda machh_, one by one. Also add the fish drippings that might have collected on the plate that held the fried fish; they are delicious.\n9. Add the fried brinjal to the curry.\n10. Let everything bubble for about 5 minutes. As the curry boils, you will notice that the colour of the _jhol_ has changed from deep yellow to bright yellow. That’s when you know that the turmeric is cooked, and that the curry won’t taste of the raw spice.\n11. Now, pick one of the softened green chillies from the curry onto a small bowl. Add ½ tsp _atta_ to it, along with 1 tbsp of water. Mash the three together, until paste-like.\n12. Add this mixture to the _jhol_. The mashed green chilli will release the heat, while the flour will help the curry thicken and develop body.\n13. Garnish with 2 more slit green chillies, a drizzle of mustard oil (about 7 g), and chopped coriander.\n14. Allow everything to bubble for a couple of more minutes, before turning off the heat.\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n","source":"_posts/pabda-machher-tel-jhol.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Pabda Machh’er Tel Jhol\ntags:\n  - fish\n  - pabda machh\n  - non-vegetarian\ndescription: >-\n  A light, hearty, delicious delicacy, the padba macher tel jhol is packed with\n  the flavours of Bengal’s prized sweetwater pabda fish.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1487900313/pabda-mach-website-thumbnail_hwdrvo.jpg\ncoverImageUrl: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1487900313/pabda-mach-website-thumbnail_hwdrvo.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: AMfGfjhJFNM\ndate: 2017-02-23 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Pabda Machh'er Tel Jhol\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1487900313/pabda-mach-thumbnail-small_ddzr4v.jpg\",\"description\":\"A light, hearty, delicious delicacy, the padba macher tel jhol is packed with the flavours of Bengal’s prized sweetwater pabda fish.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT15M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT30M\",\"recipeYield\":\"5 servings\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"450 g  Pabda machh (cut and cleaned)\",\"35 g  Mustard oil (for frying)\",\"7 g  Mustard oil (for cooking)\",\"7 g  Mustard oil (for garnish)\",\"¼ tsp  Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)\",\"5 pieces  Green chillies (slit)\",\"25 g  Tomato (roughly chopped)\",\"10 pieces  Dal’er bori\",\"100 g  Brinjal (5-cm segments)\",\"15 g (plus ¾ tsp extra for marinating)  Salt\",\"6 g (plus ¾ tsp extra for marinating)  Turmeric powder\",\"½ tsp  Atta (flour)\",\"8 g  Coriander leaves (finely chopped)\",\"400 g  Warm water\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

Smear the cut and cleaned _padba machh_ with ¾ tsp turmeric powder, ¾ tsp salt, and 1 tsp mustard oil. Mix till the fish are well coated, and set aside.\n2. Cut the brinjal into 5-cm segments. We need as many pieces of brinjal as there are fish—in this case, five.\n3. Roughly chop the tomatoes.\n4. Slit the green chillies.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE _BORI_, BRINJAL, AND FISH**\n1. Heat your _kadai_ well and add 35 g mustard oil to the pan.\n2. Once the oil is completely hot (that is, once it has begun to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow), add the _dal’er bori_.\n3. Fry the _boris_ for about 20 seconds till they are golden brown. They colour very quickly, so be alert while frying them.\n4. Remove the _boris_ from the oil and set aside.\n5. Next, add the brinjal pieces to the oil.\n6. Stir-fry for about 4 minutes till they are golden. Remove them from the oil and set aside.\n7. Now, in batches, fry the marinated fish. Fresh, sweetwater fish such as the _pabda_ do not need heavy searing. Fry them lightly to preserve their delicate flavour. A minute on each side should do the job.\n8. Remove the fried fish on a plate and reserve for later use.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING THE _JHOL_**\n1. Before we start, make a paste with 15 g salt, 6 g turmeric powder, and 50 g water. Mix and keep ready.\n2. Heat 7 g mustard oil in the _kadai_. (If the oil that you fried the fish in is not burnt, you may use the same oil to prepare the _jhol_.)\n3. Add the _kaalo jeere_, tomatoes, and 3 green chillies to the oil.\n4. Fry them for a minute on medium heat.\n5. Add the turmeric and salt mixture to the pan, and fry till the water in the spice mix dries up.\n6. Now, pour 400 g of hot water (either heated in an electric kettle or on the stove) into the pan. This will form the curry.\n7. Once the curry starts to simmer, add in the fried _boris_.\n8. Simmer for another 2 minutes before lowering in the _pabda machh_, one by one. Also add the fish drippings that might have collected on the plate that held the fried fish; they are delicious.\n9. Add the fried brinjal to the curry.\n10. Let everything bubble for about 5 minutes. As the curry boils, you will notice that the colour of the _jhol_ has changed from deep yellow to bright yellow. That’s when you know that the turmeric is cooked, and that the curry won’t taste of the raw spice.\n11. Now, pick one of the softened green chillies from the curry onto a small bowl. Add ½ tsp _atta_ to it, along with 1 tbsp of water. Mash the three together, until paste-like.\n12. Add this mixture to the _jhol_. The mashed green chilli will release the heat, while the flour will help the curry thicken and develop body.\n13. Garnish with 2 more slit green chillies, a drizzle of mustard oil (about 7 g), and chopped coriander.\n14. Allow everything to bubble for a couple of more minutes, before turning off the heat.\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n","slug":"pabda-machher-tel-jhol","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-30T02:29:28.346Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjcles75g003v0wvhx4mw8asx","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A flavourful, light curry with <em>pabda</em> fish</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">It is unbelievable that something with a handful of ingredients can taste so divine.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">T</span>he <em>pabda machh</em> is one of the most beloved of Bengal’s fishes.

Here, fresh parshe is simmered in a potent and flavourful mustard gravy. This Bengali fish-curry recipe is easy to prepare, insanely delicious, and requires only a handful of ingredients. The star of the show is, of course, fresh parshe. A freshwater catch with a soft sheen, parshe (a kind of mullet) is identifiable by its small, triangular mouth and slender shape.

Clean the fish, and coat it with ¾ tsp each of salt and turmeric. Let it rest for 15 minutes. \n2. Meanwhile, add the soaked-and-strained mustard seeds to a grinder jar along with 2 roughly chopped green chillies and 80 g water. Blitz everything into a smooth paste. The finer and non-grainier the paste, better the flavour. You may need to scrape down the sides of your jar and keep blending until the mustard paste is smooth.\n3. Coming to the veggies, roughly chop the tomato and cut the brinjal in 5-cm long pieces.\n4. In a kadai set on medium heat, heat 35 g mustard oil until it is smokes lightly and changes colour to a pale yellow. Add the dal’er bori and fry for about 20 seconds, or until the bori is golden brown. Strain from the oil and set aside. Now, in the same pan fry the brinjal until it is golden too (about 4 minutes), and starin and set aside. Finally, lower the marinated fish, one at a time. Fry fish in batches in a single layer, for a minute on each side. Drain from the oil and set these aside too. \n5. Check your oil at this point. If it is not too burnt from all the frying, add kaalo jeere to it (if it is burnt, you may want to replace it with fresh oil). Then add the chopped tomato and fry for about 10 seconds, after which add the green chillies. Fry until they crackle (another 10 seconds). \n6. Add the mustard paste and sauté on medium heat for about 4 minutes. Add the salt and turmeric, and cook for another 6 minutes until the raw smell from the spices in gone. Whenever the mixture dries out, add a splash of water and keep frying. \n7. Add the yoghurt and sugar, and cook for 2 minutes.\n8. Now add 300 g hot water. This will form the curry. Add the fried bori and allow the curry to come to a boil. Then add the fried brinjal. Simmer gently for about 3 minutes, after which lower the fried parshe one by one, making sure the fish are submerged in the curry. Do not stir or disturb too much because the fish is going to be delicate at this point and likely to break. Cook the fish in the curry for about 5 minutes on low heat. \n9. Finish off with freshly chopped coriander leaves and a drizzle of raw mustard oil (about 5 g). \n  \n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n","source":"_posts/parshe-macher-jhal-shorshe-begun-diye.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Parshe Machh’er Jhal Shorshe Diye\ntags:\n  - fish\n  - gluten free\n  - parshe\ndescription: >-\n  Fresh parshe simmered in a potent and flavourful mustard gravy, this Bengali\n  fish curry is easy to prepare and insanely delicious.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1515124581/parshe-jhol2-website-thumbnail-_zvq0vs.png\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: oTrxOqVd7-I\ndate: 2018-01-04 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Parshe Macher Shorshe Jhal\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1515124581/parshe-jhol2-website-thumbnail-_zvq0vs.png\",\"description\":\"Fresh parshe simmered in a potent and flavourful mustard gravy, this Bengali fish curry is easy to prepare and insanely delicious.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT15M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT30M\",\"recipeYield\":\"5\", \"recipeIngredient\":[\"400 g Parshe machh\",\"10 pcs Dal’er bori (sun-baked lentil dumplings)\",\"100 g Brinjal\",\"15 g Tomatoes\",\"8 g Coriander leaves\",\"5 pcs Green chillies\",\"20 g Yellow and black mustard seeds (soaked for 2 hours)\",\"25 g Yoghurt (beaten)\",\"40 g Mustard oil (for cooking and garnish)\",\"¼ tsp Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)\",\"15 g Salt (plus ¾ tsp for coating fish with)\",\"3 g Turmeric powder (plus ¾ tsp for coating fish with)\",\"8 g Sugar\",\"300 g Hot water\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

Divide the paneer into 3-cm cubes and smear it with ¼ tsp each of salt and turmeric. Heat a flat frying pan on medium heat. Once the pan is completely hot, add a millimetre of oil. Wait until the oil heats up fully and then place the paneer cubes in it in a single layer. Ensuring that the pan and oil are both hot will prevent the paneer from sticking to the pan. After about 45 seconds, flip the cubes and fry their opposite surfaces until they are golden. Fry just two of the surfaces, as frying all round will make the paneer rubbery and won’t allow absorption of curry later on. Remove from the oil and set aside.\n2. Peel and chop potatoes in 3-cm cubes. Cut the capsicum in 2-cm squares.\n3. Heat 15 g mustard oil in a _kadai_ until it starts smoking and changes colour to a pale yellow. Temper the oil with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds.\n4. Once the whole spices start crackling, add the potatoes. Cover and fry them on medium heat until the turn slightly golden (about 4 minutes).\n5. Meanwhile, make a paste with ginger, cumin powder, kashmiri red chilli powder, turmeric powder, and 100 g water. Add it to the pan and cook it along with the potatoes until the smell of raw spices is gone. This should take about 6 minutes. If you find that the spices have dried out, add a splash of hot water and continue frying.\n6. Add capsicum and 3 slit green chillies. Cover and cook for about 3 minutes until the capsicum softens.\n7. Whip the yoghurt until it is lump-free. _Lower_ the heat and add it to the pan. Stir quickly prevent the yoghurt from splitting. Cook _uncovered_ for 2 minutes.\n8. Add the blanched peas (if you’re using raw peas, add them along with the potatoes earlier on) and sugar, and cook for 2 more minutes. \n9. Now add 250 g hot water to the pan. This will form the curry. Once it comes to a boil, drop the chunks of fried paneer in it. Bubble on medium heat for about 6 minutes until the curry thickens.\n10. Garnish with _garam masala_, _ghee_, and a slit green chilli. Cover the pan and rest it for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Fried rice](/recipe/bengali-vegetable-fried-rice/)\n- Polao\n- [Luchi](/recipe/luchi/)\n","source":"_posts/paneer-dalna.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Paneer’er Dalna\ntags:\n  - vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\n  - dalna\n  - paneer\ncategories:\n  - recipe\ndescription: >-\n  Understated, warm paneer curry with flavours of ginger, ghee and garam masala.\n  Rich and comforting without being flashy.\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1507834039/paneer-dalna-website-thumbnail-_cpit62.png\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: Lx50WRubCcM\ndate: 2017-10-12 20:30:00\njsonLd:\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"post-byline\">Bengali cottage-cheese curry</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Understated, warm paneer curry with flavours of ginger, ghee and garam masala.

Remember, we don’t want to cook the cauliflower completely at this stage. The florets will be deep-fried later; we just want to give them a head-start. Three minutes of steaming should do the trick.\n3. Drain the florets immediately and set aside to cool.\n4. Meanwhile, prepare a batter by mixing flour, salt, sugar, turmeric, _kaalo jeere_, _posto_, green chilli, mustard oil, and water in the given proportions.\n5. Mix the batter till well combined.\n6. Set a _kadai_ on the stove and heat it up. Add vegetable oil to the pan, at least 4 cm deep.\n7. On medium flame, allow the oil to heat up completely (200 degree C). You can check by dropping some batter into the oil, and if it floats to the top immediately, with bubbles all around it, the oil is good to go.\n8. Dunk the steamed cauliflower florets into the batter one at a time and coat them well.\n9. Gently drop them into the oil. You can fry about 4 to 8 florets at a time, depending on the size of your pan. But be sure not to overcrowd the pan, or the florets won’t fry evenly from all sides.\n10.

It shares many of the characteristics of other eastern societies that developed around wet rice cultivation—a method that dates back to the Neolithic ages. India is the largest cultivator of paddy in the world, and West Bengal grows most of it. Bangladesh is the fourth largest producer of rice with 75 per cent of its arable land used for paddy cultivation. Suffice to say that rice—not just its consumption, but also its production—defines the Bengali culture more than we realise ourselves.\n\nIn this tropical land, summers are harsh. Farmers, labourers, artisans, who go out to work in the the fields carry with them a tiffin box of rice soaked in water, some salt, some green chillies, and a wedge of onion. This rice ferments to form _panta bhaat_. Sometimes, water is added to the cooked rice at night and had for breakfast. _Panta bhaat_ originated as, and still is, means of sustenance for the poor. Different parts of eastern India have different names for this recipe—in Orissa they call it _pakhala_, and in Assam _poita bhaat_.\n\nThe fermentation of the rice carbohydrates by good bacteria increases the availability of a lot of micronutrients and minerals in the rice. The table below shows a comparison of available nutrition of 100 grams of cooked rice and _panta bhaat_:\n\n| Minerals  | Cooked Rice | Panta Bhaat |  \n|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n| Iron      | 3.4 mg      | 73.91 mg    |\n| Sodium    | 475 mg      | 303 mg      |\n| Potassium | 21 mg       | 839 mg      |\nSource: {% link \"The Telegraph, 4 August 2011\" https://www.telegraphindia.com/1110804/jsp/northeast/story_14328967.jsp %}\n\nConsumed in summer, _panta bhaat_ supplies probiotic bacteria and plenty of micronutrients that aid digestion. It produces a soporific effect that is conducive to a siesta that Bengalis love.\n\nIn spite of its humble origin, _panta bhaat_ is loved and enjoyed by many people, rich and poor. There is no real recipe for _panta bhaat_. So, these are our serving suggestions based on what our family commonly eats with _panta_.\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 13 hours\n**YIELDS** 4 servings (75g rice per person)\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n- 300g Rice (small-grained, unperfumed, and parboiled)\n- Potatoes (halved)\n- Lime or _gondhoraj lebu_\n- Green chillies\n- Sliced onions\n- _Kasundi_ (Bengali mustard)\n- Salt\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1. The first step in this recipe is boiling the rice. Wash the rice thoroughly and fill your pot with water. As usual, we need at least five times as much water as the rice. For details, check out our video on [how to cook the perfect rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/).\n2. In the same pot as the rice, add some peeled and halved potatoes. This is so the potatoes are boiled at the same time as the rice.\n3. Set the pot on the stove and boil the rice for 10 minutes longer than you normally would—for this recipe, we need the rice to be soft and mushy.\n4. Extract the boiled potatoes from the pot. Strain the rice and set it aside to cool completely.\n5. Once the rice is cool, add regular water to the pot. The water level should be about 2 cm over the level of rice.\n6. Using your hands, gently break up the lumps in the rice.\n7. Cover and place the pot in a cool, dark place for 12 hours. This will give the rice a chance to ferment and develop good bacteria.\n8. While eating, take fistsful of rice from the pot and squeeze as much water out of it as possible. Transfer to a serving bowl.\n9. Using your hands, mash the rice thoroughly. Also mash in half a boiled potato along with it.\n10. Add some freshly squeezed lime juice, crushed green chillies, salt, and _kasundi_ to the rice. Mix to combine.\n11.

Wash the fish pieces thoroughly and pat them dry with a napkin or paper towels. Removing excess moisture from the fish will allow for the development of a crisp crust.\n2. Place the fish in a mixing dish, and add the salt, turmeric powder, arrowroot powder, and corn flour.\n3. Coat the fish pieces well. The arrowroot powder and corn flour in the marinade will absorb any remaining moisture, and allow the crust to turn golden when fried.\n3. Heat 4-cm-deep mustard oil in a _kadai_ till it starts to smoke and changes colour to a pale yellow. The frying temperature for this recipe is 180°C.\n4. Gently lower the fish in the oil, skin side down. Make sure that the fish pieces are not piled one on top of the other, but placed side by side in oil. Also, do not overcrowd the pan (frying them two at a time should suffice), as we want the oil to freely flow around the fish.\n5. Once the skin-side is golden (this should take about 6 minutes), turn the fish over to its flesh side. Fry this side for another 3 minutes.\n6. Drain from the oil on by one, by holding the pieces against the side of the _kadai_ for 20 seconds.\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- Wedge of lime | salt\n","source":"_posts/rohu-katla-fish-fry.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Katla Maachh Bhaja\ntags:\n  - fish\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - rohu\n  - katla\n  - bhaja\n  - kata pona\ndescription: >-\n  Fried katla fish (Bengal’s favourite freshwater carp)—a popular item on\n  biyebari (wedding) menus—is crunchy on the outside and juicy inside.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://http://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1492132887/katla-mach-bhaja-website-thumbnail_kh5k55.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\ndate: 2017-04-13 09:00:00\nvideoId: fC4lcB2Crjw\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Katla Maachh Bhaja\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1492132887/katla-mach-bhaja-website-thumbnail_kh5k55.jpg\",\"description\":\"Fried katla fish (Bengal’s favourite freshwater carp)—a popular item on biyebari (wedding) menus—is crunchy on the outside and juicy inside.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT15M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT30M\",\"recipeYield\":\"4\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"Katla maachh (fish) 250 g (4 large pieces)\",\"Salt ¾ tsp\",\"Turmeric ½ tsp\",\"Arrowroot powder ½ tsp\",\"Corn flour ½ tsp\",\"Mustard oil (for deep frying) ~ 100 g\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1 Wash the fish pieces thoroughly and pat them dry with a napkin or paper towels.

For this recipe, the cauliflower must be cut into chunky florets (about 5 cm large). Remember that the flavour is contained in the stem, so try to retain as much of it as possible. The florets are cooked twice—first stir-fried over medium heat to release some of their flavour, and then again with the spices and gravy. Even after all the frying and boiling, each cauliflower floret should hold its shape. It should snap when you run a knife through its stalk, and not disintegrate at touch from over-boiling.\n\n***\n**COOKING TIME**  40 minutes\n**YIELDS** 4 servings\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Sl|                Quantity | Ingredient                         |\n|---|-------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|   |**OIL**                  |                                    |\n| 1 |                    30 g | Mustard oil (for frying)           |\n| 2 |                    10 g | Mustard oil (for cooking)          |\n|   |**_PHORON_ (TEMPERING)** |                                    |\n| 3 |                2 pieces | Dried red chillies (whole)         |\n| 4 |                2 pieces | Bay leaves (whole)                 |\n| 5 |                3 pieces | Cardamom (whole)                   |\n| 6 |                3 pieces | Cloves (whole)                     |\n| 7 |                 1 piece | Cinnamon (whole)                   |\n| 8 |          1 g (or ¼ tsp) | Cumin seeds (whole)                |\n|   |**VEGETABLES**           |                                    |\n| 9 |                   500 g | Cauliflower (cut in large florets) |\n|10 |                   250 g | Potatoes (diced; 5 cm cubes)       |\n|11 |                    50 g | Peas (shelled)                     |\n|12 |                    50 g | Tomatoes (diced)                   |\n|   |**SPICES AND SEASONING** |                                    |\n|13 |                    30 g | Ginger paste                       |\n|14 |                     5 g | Cumin powder                       |\n|15 |                     1 g | Coriander powder                   |\n|16 |                     5 g | Turmeric powder                    |\n|17 |                     1 g | Red chilli powder                  |\n|18 |                    16 g | Salt                               |\n|19 |                    28 g | Sugar                              |\n|   |**GARNISH**              |                                    |\n|20 |                     7 g | Ghee                               |\n|21 |                   ½ tsp | Garam masala powder                |\n|22 |       2 g (or 2 pieces) | Green chillies (slit)              |\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | wok | frying pan | cooking pot\n- Lid for cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Electric kettle (optional)\n\n## Method\n**PART I—FRYING THE CAULIFLOWER**\n1. Cut the cauliflower in large florets, about 5 cm large.\n2. Heat 30 g mustard oil in the pan.\n3. Stir-fry the cauliflower for 5–7 minutes on medium-high heat till they develop a light amber colour.\n4. Remove the cauliflower from the pan and reserve for later use.\n\n  **PART II—TEMPERING THE OIL**\n1. Now, heat 10 g mustard oil in the same pan.\n2. Add all the _phoron_ (dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds) into the oil.\n3. Once the whole spices start crackling, add the cubed potatoes.\n4. Fry the potatoes for 5 minutes on low heat.\n\n  **PART III—SAUTEEING THE SPICES**\n1. In a small bowl, make a spice paste by adding 100 g of water to ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and red chilli powder.\n2. Add this mixture to the pan and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n3. Add the salt, sugar, and another 100 g of water, and cook till the water dries off again.\n4. Add the diced tomatoes and a slit green chilli.\n5. Once the tomatoes have assimilated into the spice mix, add in the peas and fried cauliflower.\n6. Cook the vegetables on low heat, with the lid on, for 3 minutes.\n\n  **PART IV—PREPARING THE GRAVY**\n1. Add 400 g hot water to the pan.\n2.

Cut the cauliflower in large florets, about 5 cm large.\n2. Heat 30 g mustard oil in the pan.\n3. Stir-fry the cauliflower for 5–7 minutes on medium-high heat till they develop a light amber colour.\n4. Remove the cauliflower from the pan and reserve for later use.\n\n  **PART II—TEMPERING THE OIL**\n1. Now, heat 10 g mustard oil in the same pan.\n2. Add all the _phoron_ (dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds) into the oil.\n3. Once the whole spices start crackling, add the cubed potatoes.\n4. Fry the potatoes for 5 minutes on low heat.\n\n  **PART III—SAUTEEING THE SPICES**\n1. In a small bowl, make a spice paste by adding 100 g of water to ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and red chilli powder.\n2. Add this mixture to the pan and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n3. Add the salt, sugar, and another 100 g of water, and cook till the water dries off again.\n4. Add the diced tomatoes and a slit green chilli.\n5. Once the tomatoes have assimilated into the spice mix, add in the peas and fried cauliflower.\n6. Cook the vegetables on low heat, with the lid on, for 3 minutes.\n\n  **PART IV—PREPARING THE GRAVY**\n1. Add 400 g hot water to the pan.\n2. Cook the potatoes and cauliflower with the lid on for 10 minutes till the cauliflower stalks are tender. They should snap when you run a knife through them, but the florets should not disintegrate from over-boiling.\n3. Garnish with ghee, garam masala powder, and a slit green chilli.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | _rooti_\n","slug":"phulkopir-dalna","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-30T02:30:47.951Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjcles75z004s0wvhl4ke2gvf","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A spicy cauliflower curry</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">A curry of cauliflower, potatoes, and peas that is a little hot, a little sweet, with hints of ginger, <em>ghee</em>, and <em>garam masala</em>.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">B</span>engalis generally eat this beautifully spiced curry of cauliflower in the winter months, when the vegetable is harvested in large numbers.

In a momo, since all the ingredients are steamed at the same time, cutting the vegetables finely ensures that they all cook together. Besides, you don’t want a large chunk of, say, onion in your momo, rather a little bit of everything in each bite. This step is the most important, so take you time with the chopping.","If using pork fat, hack it to a mince using your knife. If using butter, melt it in a microwave or over the stove.","To a mixing bowl, transfer the minced pork, chopped vegetables, and the fat/butter. To these, add the salt, pepper, MSG, and soy sauce.","Mix thoroughly until everything is well combined. Cover and set it in the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours, although it is best if you can do this overnight. This standing time will allow all the flavours to mingle together. Moreover, chilling the pork mix makes the job of filling the momos infinitely easier.","Now make the momo wrappers as shown in this video.","Divide the pork mix into 20 g portions. Place these back in the fridge to chill until you need them. We like to portion our filling on two separate plates, so that one can stay in the fridge until the one you’re currently using gets warm, in which case you can just switch out the plates. That way, you always have a batch of chilled pork.","Take a momo wrapper and place the pork mix at its centre. Apply water all around the edges of the wrapper and start pleating. Use your left hand to form the pleats and keep the filling inside, and right hand to pinch the pleats closed. If you’re just starting out, try resting the momos on the table for easier shaping. Beginners may also use a little less filling to practice with. For a demonstration, watch this video. Make sure that the momos are perfectly sealed and that there are no air pockets within. These might cause the momos to burst while steaming.","Grease the steaming dish with oil and arrange the momos on it. Don’t crowd the steamer. Place it over boiling water and steam for around 12 minutes (±2 minutes).

Finely chop the onions, green onions, coriander, ginger, and green chillies. In a momo, since all the ingredients are steamed at the same time, cutting the vegetables finely ensures that they all cook together. Besides, you don’t want a large chunk of, say, onion in your momo, rather a little bit of everything in each bite. This step is the most important, so take you time with the chopping.\n2. If using pork fat, hack it to a mince using your knife. If using butter, melt it in a microwave or over the stove.\n3. To a mixing bowl, transfer the minced pork, chopped vegetables, and the fat/butter. To these, add the salt, pepper, MSG, and soy sauce.\n4. Mix thoroughly until everything is well combined. Cover and set it in the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours, although it is best if you can do this overnight. This standing time will allow all the flavours to mingle together. Moreover, chilling the pork mix makes the job of filling the momos infinitely easier.\n5. Now make the momo wrappers as shown in this video.\n6. Divide the pork mix into 20 g portions. Place these back in the fridge to chill until you need them. We like to portion our filling on two separate plates, so that one can stay in the fridge until the one you’re currently using gets warm, in which case you can just switch out the plates. That way, you always have a batch of chilled pork.\n7. Take a momo wrapper and place the pork mix at its centre. Apply water all around the edges of the wrapper and start pleating. Use your left hand to form the pleats and keep the filling inside, and right hand to pinch the pleats closed. If you’re just starting out, try resting the momos on the table for easier shaping. Beginners may also use a little less filling to practice with. For a demonstration, watch this video. Make sure that the momos are perfectly sealed and that there are no air pockets within. These might cause the momos to burst while steaming.\n8. Grease the steaming dish with oil and arrange the momos on it. Don’t crowd the steamer. Place it over boiling water and steam for around 12 minutes (±2 minutes). You don’t want to overcook the momos, or they’ll become dry and chewy. \n9.

This is not a preparation in which you spice up things with ginger or cumin powder or red chilli powder. The only spice this recipe calls for is a touch of turmeric. Mostly, it relies on the salt and sugar to help draw out the moisture from the vegetables, and allow their flavours to mingle while cooked together. We don’t add water to form a gravy. Rather we cook this _torkari_ on low heat, with the lid on, for nearly 30 to 40 minutes. At the end of this slow cooking process, it reaches a state where no vegetable stands out, yet each has still held on to its flavours and integrity.\n\nComing to the selection of the veggies themselves, some type of starchy item such as a potato or sweet potato is used. These, being otherwise neutral in taste, are the perfect receptacle of the juices from the other vegetables. The mushy texture is usually contributed by pumpkin, while radish is used for the more sharper notes. Some kind of beans (such as _borboti_ or _sheem_) add crunch and colour. In the winter months, cauliflower lends the most sublime flavour to the _torkari_, in addition to providing texture. Finally, slimier vegetables such as brinjals, or cabbage or leafy greens that are prone to wilting on application of heat and salt, coat the mix with their juices and hold everything together.\n\nThere are several versions of _panchmishali torkari_. The choice of _phoron_ (or tempering) will depend on the vegetables used. In this particular recipe, we are using potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_ (yardlong beans), cabbage, and brinjal, with a tempering of _panch phoron_.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 60 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|               Quantity | Ingredient                                |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **OIL**                |                                           |\n|                   40 g | Mustard oil                               |\n| **TEMPERING (PHORON)** |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Bay leaves (whole)                        |\n|               2 pieces | Dried red chillies (whole)                |\n|                1 piece | Green chilli (slit)                       |\n|                  1 tsp | Panch phoron                              |\n| **THE VEGETABLES**     |                                           |\n|                  100 g | Brinjals (5-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  200 g | Potatoes (4-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  100 g | Sweet potatoes (4-cm cubes)               |\n|                  200 g | Pumpkin (4-cm cubes)                      |\n|                  200 g | Cauliflower (5-cm florets)                |\n|                  100 g | Borboti or yardlong beans (5-cm segments) |\n|                  100 g | Cabbage (5-cm segments)                   |\n| **THE SEASONING**      |                                           |\n|                  ½ tsp | Turmeric powder                           |\n|                   12 g | Salt                                      |\n|                   25 g | Sugar                                     |\n| **THE GARNISH**        |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Green chillies (slit)                     |\n|                   10 g | Coriander leaves (chopped)                |\n|                  ½ tsp | Bhaja masala                              |\n|                    5 g | Ghee                                      |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- Lid for the cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Peel and cut the potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin in 4 cm cubes.\n2. Cut the _borboti_, brinjal, and cabbage in segments of 5 cm each.\n3. Cut the cauliflower in florets, 5 cm large.\n4. In order to cook _panchmishali torkari_, the vegetables are stir-fried, and the order in which they are added to the pan depends upon their hardness. So, the potatoes and sweet potatoes, which are the hardest of all the veggies, are the first to enter the pan, followed by pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_, and cabbage. We deal with the brinjals separately, as explained in the next step.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Heat mustard oil in a pan till it starts to smoke lightly and the pungent smell is gone.\n2. Keeping the pan on medium heat, add in the brinjals and fry them for about 3 minutes till they are golden.\n3. Remove them from pan and reserve for later use. Frying the brinjals separately enhances their flavour.\n4. Now, in the same oil, add the tempering of dried red chillies, bay leaves, green chilli, and _panch phoron_. _Panch phoron_ is a mix of the following whole spices in equal proportion: fenugreek seeds (_methi_), fennel seeds (_mouri_), mustard seeds (_shorshe_), nigella seeds (_kaalo jeere_), and a typically Bengali spice called _radhuni_.\n5. Once the spices start to crackle, add in the potatoes and sweet potatoes to the oil.\n6. Fry these for about 3 minutes before introducing the next vegetable, that is, pumpkin.\n7. Fry the pumpkin, sweet potatoes, and potatoes together for another 3 minutes before adding the cauliflower. Basically, at intervals of 3 minutes, we add the next vegetable and stir-fry it together with the veggies already in the pan.\n8. Once the cauliflower is fried, add the _borboti_, and then, after 3 minutes, the cabbage.\n\n**STEP III—STEAMING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Once all the veggies have been fried, add in the salt and turmeric, and stir them in.\n2. At this point, lower the heat and cover the pan with a lid. The salt will help release the moisture from the vegetables, and gently steaming them with the lid on will help soften them up.\n3. Cook the vegetables like this for about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan. While doing so, be gentle, as the we don’t want the vegetables to turn into mush. (Always use a folding motion to stir the veggies around.)\n4. After 15 minutes, add the sugar and the fried brinjals, and cover and cook for another 10 minutes or so, stirring occasionally.\n5. You will know that the _torkari_ is done when the vegetables are completely tender and have integrated themselves into the dish, but still have the integrity to not fall apart to the touch.\n6. At this point, garnish with the chopped coriander leaves, green chillies, _bhaja masala_, and _ghee_.\n7. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and allow it to rest for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | Roti\n","source":"_posts/panchmishali-torkari.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Panchmishali Torkari\ndescription: Video recipe of authentic, vegetarian Bengali dish of cauliflower, beans, sweet potatoes, eggplants, cooked with panch phoron tempering.\ntags:\n  - vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\n  - torkari\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1485389957/website-thumbnail-panchmishalitorkari_t7jruj.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: DWY8qtUC9K0\ndate: 2017-01-26 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Panchmishali Torkari\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1485389957/thumbnail-small-panchmishalitorkari_pexgac.jpg\",\"description\":\"Panchmishali torkari is any Bengali mixed-vegetable preparation, in which the vegetables are first stir-fried and then steamed in their own juices till they are tender and well-integrated.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT20M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT60M\",\"recipeYield\":\"5 servings\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"40 g  Mustard oil\",\"2 pieces  Bay leaves (whole)\",\"2 pieces  Dried red chillies (whole)\",\"1 piece  Green chilli (slit)\",\"1 tsp  Panch phoron\",\"100 g  Brinjals (5-cm cubes)\",\"200 g  Potatoes (4-cm cubes)\",\"100 g  Sweet potatoes (4-cm cubes)\",\"200 g  Pumpkin (4-cm cubes)\",\"200 g  Cauliflower (5-cm florets)\",\"100 g  Borboti or yardlong beans (5-cm segments)\",\"100 g  Cabbage (5-cm segments)\",\"½ tsp  Turmeric powder\",\"12 g  Salt\",\"25 g  Sugar\",\"2 pieces  Green chillies (slit)\",\"10 g  Coriander leaves (chopped)\",\"½ tsp  Bhaja masala\",\"5 g  Ghee\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

At the end of this slow cooking process, it reaches a state where no vegetable stands out, yet each has still held on to its flavours and integrity.\n\nComing to the selection of the veggies themselves, some type of starchy item such as a potato or sweet potato is used. These, being otherwise neutral in taste, are the perfect receptacle of the juices from the other vegetables. The mushy texture is usually contributed by pumpkin, while radish is used for the more sharper notes. Some kind of beans (such as _borboti_ or _sheem_) add crunch and colour. In the winter months, cauliflower lends the most sublime flavour to the _torkari_, in addition to providing texture. Finally, slimier vegetables such as brinjals, or cabbage or leafy greens that are prone to wilting on application of heat and salt, coat the mix with their juices and hold everything together.\n\nThere are several versions of _panchmishali torkari_. The choice of _phoron_ (or tempering) will depend on the vegetables used. In this particular recipe, we are using potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_ (yardlong beans), cabbage, and brinjal, with a tempering of _panch phoron_.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 60 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|               Quantity | Ingredient                                |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **OIL**                |                                           |\n|                   40 g | Mustard oil                               |\n| **TEMPERING (PHORON)** |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Bay leaves (whole)                        |\n|               2 pieces | Dried red chillies (whole)                |\n|                1 piece | Green chilli (slit)                       |\n|                  1 tsp | Panch phoron                              |\n| **THE VEGETABLES**     |                                           |\n|                  100 g | Brinjals (5-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  200 g | Potatoes (4-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  100 g | Sweet potatoes (4-cm cubes)               |\n|                  200 g | Pumpkin (4-cm cubes)                      |\n|                  200 g | Cauliflower (5-cm florets)                |\n|                  100 g | Borboti or yardlong beans (5-cm segments) |\n|                  100 g | Cabbage (5-cm segments)                   |\n| **THE SEASONING**      |                                           |\n|                  ½ tsp | Turmeric powder                           |\n|                   12 g | Salt                                      |\n|                   25 g | Sugar                                     |\n| **THE GARNISH**        |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Green chillies (slit)                     |\n|                   10 g | Coriander leaves (chopped)                |\n|                  ½ tsp | Bhaja masala                              |\n|                    5 g | Ghee                                      |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- Lid for the cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Peel and cut the potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin in 4 cm cubes.\n2. Cut the _borboti_, brinjal, and cabbage in segments of 5 cm each.\n3. Cut the cauliflower in florets, 5 cm large.\n4. In order to cook _panchmishali torkari_, the vegetables are stir-fried, and the order in which they are added to the pan depends upon their hardness. So, the potatoes and sweet potatoes, which are the hardest of all the veggies, are the first to enter the pan, followed by pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_, and cabbage. We deal with the brinjals separately, as explained in the next step.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Heat mustard oil in a pan till it starts to smoke lightly and the pungent smell is gone.\n2. Keeping the pan on medium heat, add in the brinjals and fry them for about 3 minutes till they are golden.\n3. Remove them from pan and reserve for later use. Frying the brinjals separately enhances their flavour.\n4. Now, in the same oil, add the tempering of dried red chillies, bay leaves, green chilli, and _panch phoron_. _Panch phoron_ is a mix of the following whole spices in equal proportion: fenugreek seeds (_methi_), fennel seeds (_mouri_), mustard seeds (_shorshe_), nigella seeds (_kaalo jeere_), and a typically Bengali spice called _radhuni_.\n5. Once the spices start to crackle, add in the potatoes and sweet potatoes to the oil.\n6. Fry these for about 3 minutes before introducing the next vegetable, that is, pumpkin.\n7. Fry the pumpkin, sweet potatoes, and potatoes together for another 3 minutes before adding the cauliflower. Basically, at intervals of 3 minutes, we add the next vegetable and stir-fry it together with the veggies already in the pan.\n8. Once the cauliflower is fried, add the _borboti_, and then, after 3 minutes, the cabbage.\n\n**STEP III—STEAMING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Once all the veggies have been fried, add in the salt and turmeric, and stir them in.\n2. At this point, lower the heat and cover the pan with a lid. The salt will help release the moisture from the vegetables, and gently steaming them with the lid on will help soften them up.\n3. Cook the vegetables like this for about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan. While doing so, be gentle, as the we don’t want the vegetables to turn into mush. (Always use a folding motion to stir the veggies around.)\n4. After 15 minutes, add the sugar and the fried brinjals, and cover and cook for another 10 minutes or so, stirring occasionally.\n5. You will know that the _torkari_ is done when the vegetables are completely tender and have integrated themselves into the dish, but still have the integrity to not fall apart to the touch.\n6. At this point, garnish with the chopped coriander leaves, green chillies, _bhaja masala_, and _ghee_.\n7. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and allow it to rest for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | Roti\n","slug":"panchmishali-torkari","published":1,"updated":"2017-03-03T06:15:23.172Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjcles76700560wvhuuodr3vl","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">Simple Bengali mixed veggies with <em>panch phoron</em> tempering</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\"><em>Panchmishali torkari</em> is any Bengali mixed-vegetable preparation, in which the vegetables are first stir-fried and then steamed in their own juices till they are tender and well-integrated.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">A</span>s you might have guessed, the stars of this dish are the veggies themselves.

While producing good _kababs_ generally requires special grilling, charring or _tandoori_ techniques, _shami kabab_ can be easily prepared at home with no special equipment. Popular on the Indian subcontinent, this snack resembles a pan-fried, ground-meat patty. It is best made with a lean, boneless red meat of your choice (mutton, beef, lamb, etc.). It is important that the meat has a low fat but high muscle content. Fat within the meat tends to melt the kabab when it is fried, while we want it to hold itself together. More muscle and fibre, on the other hand, will ensure that the meat has some texture when it is ground, providing a satisfying resistance with each bite. The use of _chhola’r dal_ (split Bengal gram) adds nuttiness. Besides that, the other flavours come from chopped mint leaves, green chillies, _garam masala_, and ghee. We use a beaten egg to bind everything together. Depending on the recipe, such kababs may sometimes be coated in eggs or bread crumbs before they are fried. We, however, fry them directly so that the meat itself forms a rich, brown, caramelised crust.  \n\n\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 2 hours   \n**YIELDS** 16–17 kababs\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n\n| Quantity | Ingredient                            | \n|----------|---------------------------------------|\n|     1 kg | Boneless mutton or beef (lean)        |\n|    200 g | Chhola’r dal (split Bengal gram)      |\n|    100 g | Onions                                |\n|     30 g | Ginger                                |\n|     20 g | Garlic                                |\n|    4 pcs | Bay leaves                            |\n|    8 pcs | Dried red chillies                    |\n|     16 g | Green chillies                        |\n|     10 g | Mint leaves                           |\n|     30 g | Raisins                               |\n|     10 g | Lime juice                            |\n|      4 g | [Shahi garam masala](recipe/shahi-garam-masala/)                    |\n|      5 g | Ghee                                  |\n|        1 | Beaten egg                            |\n|       20 | Salt                                  |\n|  ~ 200 g | Vegetable oil (1-cm deep, for frying) |\n\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot\n- Flat frying pan | skillet\n-  _Jhhajhhri_ | perforated frying spoon\n- _Jhuri_ | draining rack | colander \n\n\n## Method\n\n1.

While producing good _kababs_ generally requires special grilling, charring or _tandoori_ techniques, _shami kabab_ can be easily prepared at home with no special equipment. Popular on the Indian subcontinent, this snack resembles a pan-fried, ground-meat patty. It is best made with a lean, boneless red meat of your choice (mutton, beef, lamb, etc.). It is important that the meat has a low fat but high muscle content. Fat within the meat tends to melt the kabab when it is fried, while we want it to hold itself together. More muscle and fibre, on the other hand, will ensure that the meat has some texture when it is ground, providing a satisfying resistance with each bite. The use of _chhola’r dal_ (split Bengal gram) adds nuttiness. Besides that, the other flavours come from chopped mint leaves, green chillies, _garam masala_, and ghee. We use a beaten egg to bind everything together. Depending on the recipe, such kababs may sometimes be coated in eggs or bread crumbs before they are fried. We, however, fry them directly so that the meat itself forms a rich, brown, caramelised crust.  \n\n\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 2 hours   \n**YIELDS** 16–17 kababs\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n\n| Quantity | Ingredient                            | \n|----------|---------------------------------------|\n|     1 kg | Boneless mutton or beef (lean)        |\n|    200 g | Chhola’r dal (split Bengal gram)      |\n|    100 g | Onions                                |\n|     30 g | Ginger                                |\n|     20 g | Garlic                                |\n|    4 pcs | Bay leaves                            |\n|    8 pcs | Dried red chillies                    |\n|     16 g | Green chillies                        |\n|     10 g | Mint leaves                           |\n|     30 g | Raisins                               |\n|     10 g | Lime juice                            |\n|      4 g | [Shahi garam masala](recipe/shahi-garam-masala/)                    |\n|      5 g | Ghee                                  |\n|        1 | Beaten egg                            |\n|       20 | Salt                                  |\n|  ~ 200 g | Vegetable oil (1-cm deep, for frying) |\n\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot\n- Flat frying pan | skillet\n-  _Jhhajhhri_ | perforated frying spoon\n- _Jhuri_ | draining rack | colander \n\n\n## Method\n\n1.

Add this mixture to the flour and proceed as instructed. \n \n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 2 hours\n**YIELDS** 4 tingmos\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                   |\n|----------|------------------------------|\n|    250 g | Maida (flour)                |\n|      5 g | Salt                         |\n|     10 g | Sugar                        |\n|      3 g | Dry instant yeast            |\n|    145 g | Warm water                   |\n|   2 tbsp | Vegetable oil (for greasing) |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Rolling pin\n- Steamer\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, sugar, yeast, and water. See the note above to correctly activate your yeast. Once the ingredients have come together, transfer the dough to the work surface. \n2. Knead the dough for 15 minutes, repeatedly folding the dough over itself to develop gluten. Round the dough by tucking all the edges at the bottom and return it to the mixing bowl, now greased with oil, to prevent the dough from sticking.\n3. Cover and proof the dough in a warm place for 1 hour, until the dough doubles in size.\n4. Dust the work surface with flour and transfer the dough to it. Flatten the dough into a rectangle with your palms. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a thin sheet, 40 cm by 45 cm in dimensions, maintaining its rectangular shape as much as possible. \n5. Apply oil on the sheet and fold its longer side into thirds. \n6. Use a knife to divide the folded dough into four equal parts. Divide each quarter further into 6 long strips. \n7. Stack the strips in pairs of threes such that you now have four sets of strips.\n8. Form the tingmo as shown in the video and place it on a greased steaming dish.\n9.

Once such snack is the delicious (may we even say nutritious?) Kolkata-style vegetable chop, also known as ‘beet chop’ or ‘veg cutlet’. Best championed by patrons of roadside shacks, ‘telebhaja dokan’, and cabins, this popular and easy-to-make Bengali vegetarian snack is enjoyed with a simple salad of onions and cucumbers, and a dollop of kasundi. Full of the goodness of the seasonal beetroots and carrots, both of which are winter vegetables in Bengal, the vegetable chop (or veg cutlet) is crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and rather sweet to taste. It is a landmine of flavour and texture, which come from the veggies, spices, and nuts used.\n</p>\n\nIn this Bengali vegetable chop recipe, we recreate a Kolkata street food, which is also one of the most beloved Bengali snacks of all time. The main ingredient of this easy Bengali veg recipe is beetroot, which lends the chop its characteristic vibrant maroon colour. Besides that, this recipe also uses a unique blend of spices. Follow this video to learn how to make a Kolkata-style vegetable chop of the perfect texture and flavour.\n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 90 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 16 chops\n**CALORIES** 141 kcal per chop\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|               Quantity | Ingredient                        | \n|------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                  400 g | Beetroot                          |\n|                  200 g | Carrots                           |\n|                  400 g | Potatoes                          |\n|                    2 g | Cumin seeds                       |\n|                    5 g | Fennel seeds                      |\n|                  8 pcs | Cloves                            |\n|                  2 pcs | Cardamom                          |\n|                   1 pc | Cinnamon                          |\n|                  20 pc | Peppercorns                       |\n|                  4 pcs | Bay leaves                        |\n|                  4 pcs | Dried red chillies                |\n|                    4 g | Amchur (dry mango powder)         |\n|                   20 g | Coconut (sliced)                  |\n|                   30 g | Peanuts (halved)                  |\n|                  ½ tsp | Panch phoron                      |\n|                   30 g | Ginger paste                      |\n|                    6 g | Green chillies (finely chopped)   |\n|                   20 g | Salt                              |\n|                   35 g | Sugar                             |\n|                   10 g | Ghee                              |\n|                    8 g | Coriander leaves (finely chopped) |\n| **FOR BREADING CHOPS** |                                   |\n|                   30 g | Flour                             |\n|                      3 | Eggs (beaten)                     |\n|                  200 g | Breadcrumbs                       |\n|                 ~300 g | Vegetable oil (for deep frying)   |\n\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot | steamer \n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n-  _Khunti_ | long spatula\n- _Jhhanjhhri_ | perforated frying spoon\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Grinder\n\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—MAKE THE FILLING**\n1. Halve or quarter the potatoes and steam them until they are tender. Peel the skins and mash thoroughly. Steaming keeps the potatoes dry and fluffy.\n2. Chop beetroot and carrots into 3-cm matchsticks. Finely chop the green chillies and coriander. Divide the coconut into 5 mm chunks. \n3.

Halve or quarter the potatoes and steam them until they are tender. Peel the skins and mash thoroughly. Steaming keeps the potatoes dry and fluffy.\n2. Chop beetroot and carrots into 3-cm matchsticks. Finely chop the green chillies and coriander. Divide the coconut into 5 mm chunks. \n3. Grind together cumin, fennel, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, peppercorns, bay leaves, dried red chillies, and amchur.\n4. In a pan, heat 30 g vegetable oil. Add the coconut slices and fry them until they are golden. This should take about 30 seconds. Remove them from the oil and set aside. Next, add the peanuts and fry them too until they are golden (about 75 seconds). Drain and set aside.\n5. Temper the same oil with panch phoron. Wait for it to crackle. Add the chopped green chillies and ginger paste, and fry for about 2 minutes. \n6. Follow these with the chopped beetroot, along with a large pinch or two of salt (to help soften the beet). Cook until the beet turns slightly limp, about 3 minutes, after which add the chopped carrots. Add the remaining salt and cook the veggies on medium heat until they are soft. However, don’t let them turn mushy or disintegrate, or we’ll lose texture.\n7. Once the vegetables are well done, add the ground spices, cover the pan, and allow everything to cook for about 2 minutes. After that, add the sugar followed by mashed potatoes. Mix everything gently until uniform so that the strands of carrots and beet do not break. \n8. Turn off the heat and add ghee, fried coconut and peanuts, and chopped coriander. Mix well. Allow the mixture to cool completely.\n\n\n**STEP II—BREADING AND FRYING**\n1. Divide into 50 g portions and form cylindrical croquettes about 7 cm long and 3 cm in diameter. Once all the chops are formed, it’s time to bread them.\n2. Dredge the chops lightly in flour and dip them in the eggwash. Transfer them on to a dish of breadcrumbs and cover them entirely, pressing them so that they stick. Repeat this eggwash-and-breadcrumb routine one more time to form a second layer of the coating. This will give extra crispy chops. You may prepare the chops up to this stage and freeze them in airtight containers for up to a month. Fry them as you need them—there’s no need to defrost.\n3.

Cooling foods slowly start getting incorporated into the diet to combat the rising temperatures.

One byproduct of this storm is that it causes a lot of mangoes to prematurely fall off trees. While that is not good news for ardent lovers of this fleshy, tropical fruit, it gives us an opportunity to prepare a rather delightful _tok dal_ out of the unripe, sour, green mangoes.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 30 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 4 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient       |\n|----------|------------------|\n|    100 g | Mosur dal        |\n|    650 g | Water            |\n|    100 g | Unripe mango     |\n|     15 g | Mustard oil      |\n|    1 tsp | Mustard seeds    |\n|    2 pcs | Green chillies   |\n|     1 pc | Dried red chilli |\n|    ¼ tsp | Turmeric powder  |\n|     12 g | Salt             |\n|     38 g | Sugar            |\n\n## Equipment\n- Pressure cooker | boiling pot\n- _Dal’er knaata_ | balloon whisk\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n\n1. Wash and rinse the [_mosur dal_](/tags/mosur-dal/), and place it in a pressure cooker or boiling pot, with 650 g water. Boil the _dal_ till it is soft, but not mushy. If using a pressure cooker, boil for one whistle, and then release the steam immediately to stop the lentils from cooking any further.\n2. Peel the unripe mango, and divide it into wedges, 2 cm thick. Reserve the cut pieces in a bowl of water till needed, to prevent the mangoes from oxidizing.\n3. Heat a _kadai_ and add 15 g mustard oil to it.\n4. Temper the oil with the dried red chilli, green chillies, and mustard seeds.\n5. Once the mustard seeds start to crackle, add the mango wedges, followed by about 2 g of salt.\n6. Stir the salt in, cover the pan, and allow the mangoes to cook on low heat for about 5 minutes. The salt will help the mangoes soften. Stir occasionally to prevent the mangoes from sticking to the pan.\n7. Once the mangoes are soft, add the boiled _dal_, turmeric powder, sugar, and rest of the salt.\n8. Allow everything to bubble on medium heat for about 6 minutes. During this time, the mangoes will release their tartness into the _dal_.\n9. This dish is sweet and tangy. Depending on the sourness of your mango, mash some of the softened pieces to a pulp and mix them with the dal.\n10. Boil for another 2 minutes before turning off the heat.\n\n\n## Served with\n[Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | _panta bhaat_\n[_Bhaja_](/tags/bhaja/) | [_torkari_](/tags/torkari/)\n","source":"_posts/tok-dal-aam-diye.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Tok Dal with Green Mangoes\ntags:\n  - dal\n  - vegetarian\n  - vegan\ndescription: >-\n  This delightful, sweet, tangy masoor dal—containing unripe, green mangoes—is\n  incredibly cooling.
