Suffice it to say that it is probably unlike anything you’ve ever tasted, especially if seasoned with the right amount of salt and sugar. And we won’t even go into how drop-dead gorgeous the finished product is. The recipe is ridiculously simple. You smear thickly sliced brinjals in turmeric and seasoning, and fry them on medium heat in a skillet. The sugar in the marinade allows the brinjals to develop a wonderfully amber-coloured crust, and deepens the flavour of the dish. If you have 20 minutes to spare, give this recipe a try. Eat it along with steaming rice and dal, and you will not regret it.\n\nThis recipe uses one large brinjal. When shopping for the vegetable, be sure to select a specimen of the male variety as it is likely to contain far fewer seeds than its female counterpart. You can identify the type of the brinjal by looking at the indentation on its bottom. If the indentation is elongated and deep, it’s a female brinjal. And if it is round and shallow, that’s the seedless, male brinjal.</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 20 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 6 slices of _begun bhaja_\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient               |\n|----------|--------------------------|\n|  1 piece | Large brinjal            |\n|    ¼ tsp | Turmeric powder          |\n|  a pinch | Red chilli powder        |\n|    ¾ tsp | Salt                     |\n|   1½ tsp | Sugar                    |\n|    ¾ tsp | Flour (atta)             |\n|    ~80 g | Mustard oil (for frying) |\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Frying pan | skillet\n- Long spatula | _khunti_ | fork\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1.

Cut the cabbage into the thinnest possible shreds that you can manage. To make this process easier, deal with the vegetable in sections of 5 cm each. Take a segment, one at a time, and shave off shreds along its cross-section with your knife. Take your time with the cutting, because the outcome of the dish will depend on this step. [Watch this video, which shows you how to cut cabbage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3EUuW5S7s) for _badhakopi'r ghonto_.\n\n**PART II—TEMPERING THE OIL (_PHORON_)**\n2. Heat 15 g mustard oil in a pan till it begins to smoke.\n3. Add the _phoron_ (comprising the dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and cumin seeds) to the oil.\n4. Once the spices start crackling, add in the cubed potatoes.\n5. Fry the potatoes for 3 minutes on low heat, with the lid on.\n\n**PART III—SAUTEEING THE SPICES**\n6. Make a paste by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and 80 g of water.\n7. Add this mixture to the potatoes and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n8. Add in the diced tomatoes and shelled peas.\n9. Then, add another 80 g of water and sautee the spices till the water dries off.\n10. Add a slit green chilli and cook with the lid on for another minute.\n\n**PART IV—STEAMING THE CABBAGE**\n11. Add the shredded cabbage to the pan, along with the salt.\n12. Fold in the spices and cook on low heat with the lid on. The salt will start dehydrating the cabbage and drawing out its moisture.\n13. Steam the cabbage on low heat, with the lid on, for 12 minutes, stirring intermittently. Keep an eye on the pan to ensure that the cabbage doesn’t stick to the bottom.\n14. Add the sugar and cook for another 15 minutes, stirring intermittently. The sugar will soon start to caramelise. Be sure to scrape down and integrate the lightly browned bits of the _torkari_ that stick to the bottom of your pan (they are yummy!).\n15. This step is optional. You can coat a couple of cleaned prawns in a pinch of salt and turmeric powder, and fry in a separate pan for 30 seconds on each side. Chop the fried prawns in chunks of 1 cm, and add to the _ghonto_.\n16. Garnish with _ghee_, powdered _garam masala_, and a  slit green chilli.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | roti\n","source":"_posts/badhakopir-ghonto.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Badhakopi'r Ghonto | Dry Cabbage and Peas Curry\ndescription: A mildly spiced dry cabbage curry with peas-a kind of Bengali vegetarian ghonto with delicate flavours of ginger, garam masala and ghee.\ntags:\n  - ghonto\n  - torkari\n  - vegetarian\n  - vegan\n  - gluten-free\n  - cabbage\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1479339208/badhakopir-ghonto_thumbnail_c7ocub.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: nmkY-fGFTuY\ndate: 2016-12-01 20:30:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Badhakopi'r ghonto\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1479339208/badhakopir-ghonto_cover-small_uif59l.jpg\",\"description\":\"This is a beautifully spiced cabbage and peas preparation that is hot, sweet, and with hints of ginger, ghee, and garam masala.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT10M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT45M\",\"recipeYield\":\"4\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"Mustard oil (for cooking) 15 g\",\"Dried red chillies 1 piece\",\"Bay leaves 1 piece\",\"Cardamom 1 piece\",\"Cloves 1 piece\",\"Cinnamon 1 piece\",\"Cumin seeds 2 g (or ¼ tsp)\",\"Cabbage 400 g\",\"Potatoes 100 g\",\"Peas 50 g\",\"Tomatoes 30 g\",\"Prawns (optional) 75 g\",\"Ginger paste 20 g\",\"Cumin powder 2 g\",\"Coriander powder 1 g\",\"Turmeric powder 3 g\",\"Red chilli powder 1 g\",\"Salt 10 g\",\"Sugar 25 g\",\"Ghee 4 g\",\"Garam masala ¼ tsp\",\"Green chillies 2 g (or 2 pieces)\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1 Cut the cabbage into the thinnest possible shreds that you can manage.

This will also prevent the moisture generated by the cabbage from evaporating too quickly; (5) Stir intermittently to prevent sticking.\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 45 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 6 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|       Quantity | Ingredient                               |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------|\n|           15 g | Mustard oil                              |\n|        1 piece | Dried red chilli (whole)                 |\n|        1 piece | Bay leaf (whole)                         |\n|        1 piece | Cardamom (whole)                         |\n|        1 piece | Clove (whole)                            |\n|        1 piece | Cinnamon (whole)                         |\n| 2 g (or ¼ tsp) | Cumin seeds                              |\n|          400 g | Cabbage (cut into thin shreds, 2 mm wide)|\n|          100 g | Potatoes (diced; 3 cm cubes)             |\n|           50 g | Peas (shelled)                           |\n|           30 g | Tomatoes (diced)                         |\n|           75 g | Prawns (optional; shelled and deveined)  |\n|           20 g | Ginger paste                             |\n|            2 g | Cumin powder                             |\n|            1 g | Coriander powder                         |\n|            3 g | Turmeric powder                          |\n|            1 g | Red chilli powder                        |\n|           10 g | Salt                                     |\n|           25 g | Sugar                                    |\n|            4 g | Ghee                                     |\n|          ¼ tsp | Garam masala powder                      |\n|       2 pieces | Green chillies (slit)                    |\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | wok\n- Lid for cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**PART I—CUTTING THE CABBAGE**\n1. Cut the cabbage into the thinnest possible shreds that you can manage. To make this process easier, deal with the vegetable in sections of 5 cm each. Take a segment, one at a time, and shave off shreds along its cross-section with your knife. Take your time with the cutting, because the outcome of the dish will depend on this step. [Watch this video, which shows you how to cut cabbage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3EUuW5S7s) for _badhakopi'r ghonto_.\n\n**PART II—TEMPERING THE OIL (_PHORON_)**\n2. Heat 15 g mustard oil in a pan till it begins to smoke.\n3. Add the _phoron_ (comprising the dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and cumin seeds) to the oil.\n4. Once the spices start crackling, add in the cubed potatoes.\n5. Fry the potatoes for 3 minutes on low heat, with the lid on.\n\n**PART III—SAUTEEING THE SPICES**\n6. Make a paste by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and 80 g of water.\n7. Add this mixture to the potatoes and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n8. Add in the diced tomatoes and shelled peas.\n9. Then, add another 80 g of water and sautee the spices till the water dries off.\n10. Add a slit green chilli and cook with the lid on for another minute.\n\n**PART IV—STEAMING THE CABBAGE**\n11. Add the shredded cabbage to the pan, along with the salt.\n12. Fold in the spices and cook on low heat with the lid on. The salt will start dehydrating the cabbage and drawing out its moisture.\n13. Steam the cabbage on low heat, with the lid on, for 12 minutes, stirring intermittently. Keep an eye on the pan to ensure that the cabbage doesn’t stick to the bottom.\n14. Add the sugar and cook for another 15 minutes, stirring intermittently. The sugar will soon start to caramelise. Be sure to scrape down and integrate the lightly browned bits of the _torkari_ that stick to the bottom of your pan (they are yummy!).\n15. This step is optional. You can coat a couple of cleaned prawns in a pinch of salt and turmeric powder, and fry in a separate pan for 30 seconds on each side. Chop the fried prawns in chunks of 1 cm, and add to the _ghonto_.\n16. Garnish with _ghee_, powdered _garam masala_, and a  slit green chilli.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | roti\n","slug":"badhakopir-ghonto","published":1,"updated":"2017-03-03T06:13:49.512Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cj0381pu30005usvhzvdwtb66","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A dry curry of cabbage</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">This is a beautifully spiced cabbage-and-peas preparation that is a little hot, a little sweet, and with hints of ginger, <em>ghee</em>, and <em>garam masala</em>.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">B</span><em>adhakopi’r ghonto</em> is essentially prepared by steaming fine shreds of cabbage (about 2 mm wide) in their own moisture, which is drawn out with the help of salt.

It is a blend of whole spices, whose proportions vary from cuisine to cuisine. The Bengali version comprises three simple spices—cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves.</p>","more":"<p><span class=\"dropcap\">W</span>hile the <em>garam masala</em> used in most northern and western Indian cooking might contain everything from coriander and cumin seeds to mustard seeds, the Bengali version, in its most basic form, is made up of cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves. The preparation is simple. We dry-roast a blend of the whole spices to awaken their dormant flavours and powder them—either by hand on in an electric grinder. If stored in an airtight container, the <em>masala</em> can keep for months.  </p>\n<p>In Bengali cooking, <em>garam masala</em> is used to flavour egg, chicken, mutton, lamb, or beef curries. Along with <em>ghee</em>, it is also used as garnish for several vegetarian preparations (most <em>ghontos</em> and <a href=\"/tags/dalna/\" title=\"Bengali dalna recipes\"><em>dalnas</em></a>, <em>khichuri</em>, and <em>panchmishali torkari</em>). This spice is particularly handy if you want to quickly refresh leftovers.

Once the whole spices start to crackle in oil, add the chopped onions and sugar to the pan and fry on medium heat for 5–7 minutes.\n4. Add the ginger paste and minced garlic to the pan, and fry for another 3–4 minutes.\n5. Make a spice paste by adding 50 g water to the cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and salt.\n6. Add this mixture to the pan and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n7. Then, add another 50g of water, along with the tomatoes and green chilli, and cook till the water dries off again.\n8. Add the parboiled potatoes and cook on low heat for 2 minutes.\n9. Then add the eggs. Cook for another minute. Stop here if you want _dim’er kosha_, a rich gravy to accompany your fried rice or _luchi_.

Using a slicer, cut the potatoes into 2-mm-thick slices. Alternatively, you can also use a sharp knife cut thin slices by hand. Reserve the slices in a large bowl full of water to prevent the potatoes from oxidizing.\n2. Wash the potato slices in plenty of water to remove the starch. Doing so will allow the alu bhaja to crisp up nicely. Change the water 2–3 times during this process to make sure that most of the starch is gone. Drain the water when done.\n3. Now, lay out absorbent towels on a surface and spread out the washed potato slices in a single layer. We want the potatoes to be completely dry before we move on to the next stage—moisture will make the fries limp. Take your time. Dab them with another towel, or let them air dry for long as it takes for them to be completely dry.\n4. Bunch together 5–6 slices at a time, and chop them into matchsticks, 2-mm-wide.\n5. Heat about 500 g vegetable oil in a pan. The secret to non-greasy fries is to use a lot of oil. The excessive amount of oil will allow the potato juliennes to float freely, rather than lump together and trap steam. The temperature of the oil is also important for this recipe. It should be adequately hot (at around 180°C), but should never reach the smoking point.\n6. Once the oil is hot, fry the peanuts for 20 seconds, drain, and reserve for later. Do the same with the curry leaves—but fry them for 10 seconds.\n7. Now, drop a small handful of potatoes into the oil. It is important not to overcrowd the pan. When the potatoes hit the oil, they will release a lot of steam. With time, the bubbles will gradually start subsiding (in about 3 minutes or so). The process of frying essentially serves to dehydrates the potatoes—that is what lets them turn crisp and stay crisp longer. When the moisture has all evaporated as steam bubbles, you know that the alu bhaja is now crisp. Fry for another 2 minutes for it to develop colour.\n7. Strain the alu bhaja from the oil, and transfer to a perforated vessel (such as a colander or wicker basket) to cool. A basket allows the remaining steam to get out. Otherwise the steam will condense into water as the fries cool and making them limp.\n8. Garnish with the fried peanuts and curry leaves.\n9. FOR THE SEASONING, mix together the freshly ground pepper, salt, rock salt, chaat masala, and red chilli powder in the given proportions. Sprinkle this mix on the alu bhaja just before eating.

Crispy, fried potato juliennes—served alongside some steaming rice, hot dal, and a wedge of lemon—tend to justify their own existence.<br></p></p>\n<p>For this recipe, we’ve borrowed the principles of French-fry making, and applied them to jhuri alu bhaja. Three important things need to be kept in mind: (1) The cut potatoes should be washed in plenty of water to rid them of starch; (2) before frying, the potatoes must be thoroughly dried—any moisture will yield limp fries; and (3) the potato juliennes must be fried in a pan full of oil, at a steady temperature of 180°C (that is, the oil should be hot, but not so hot that it begins to smoke).</p>\n\n<p>Without further ado, let’s get into the step-by-step guide to making the perfectly crisp jhuri alu bhaja every single time.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 45 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 8 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>400 g</td>\n<td>Potatoes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25 g</td>\n<td>Peanuts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 sprig</td>\n<td>Curry leaves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>500 g</td>\n<td>Vegetable oil (for frying)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Pepper (crushed)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Rock salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Chaat masala</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pinch</td>\n<td>Red chilli powder</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Any good slicer</li>\n<li>Sharp knife</li>\n<li>2–3 clean, absorbent towels</li>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan</li>\n<li>Frying spoon | perforated spoon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n<li>Grater | grinder</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Using a slicer, cut the potatoes into 2-mm-thick slices. Alternatively, you can also use a sharp knife cut thin slices by hand. Reserve the slices in a large bowl full of water to prevent the potatoes from oxidizing.</li>\n<li>Wash the potato slices in plenty of water to remove the starch. Doing so will allow the alu bhaja to crisp up nicely. Change the water 2–3 times during this process to make sure that most of the starch is gone. Drain the water when done.</li>\n<li>Now, lay out absorbent towels on a surface and spread out the washed potato slices in a single layer. We want the potatoes to be completely dry before we move on to the next stage—moisture will make the fries limp. Take your time. Dab them with another towel, or let them air dry for long as it takes for them to be completely dry.</li>\n<li>Bunch together 5–6 slices at a time, and chop them into matchsticks, 2-mm-wide.</li>\n<li>Heat about 500 g vegetable oil in a pan. The secret to non-greasy fries is to use a lot of oil. The excessive amount of oil will allow the potato juliennes to float freely, rather than lump together and trap steam. The temperature of the oil is also important for this recipe. It should be adequately hot (at around 180°C), but should never reach the smoking point.</li>\n<li>Once the oil is hot, fry the peanuts for 20 seconds, drain, and reserve for later. Do the same with the curry leaves—but fry them for 10 seconds.</li>\n<li>Now, drop a small handful of potatoes into the oil. It is important not to overcrowd the pan. When the potatoes hit the oil, they will release a lot of steam. With time, the bubbles will gradually start subsiding (in about 3 minutes or so). The process of frying essentially serves to dehydrates the potatoes—that is what lets them turn crisp and stay crisp longer. When the moisture has all evaporated as steam bubbles, you know that the alu bhaja is now crisp. Fry for another 2 minutes for it to develop colour.</li>\n<li>Strain the alu bhaja from the oil, and transfer to a perforated vessel (such as a colander or wicker basket) to cool. A basket allows the remaining steam to get out. Otherwise the steam will condense into water as the fries cool and making them limp.</li>\n<li>Garnish with the fried peanuts and curry leaves.</li>\n<li>FOR THE SEASONING, mix together the freshly ground pepper, salt, rock salt, chaat masala, and red chilli powder in the given proportions. Sprinkle this mix on the alu bhaja just before eating. Salt, being hygroscopic, tends to absorb moisture from the air, and turn the crisps soggy. If you don’t add the seasoning, the alu bhaja should last for up to 7 days in an airtight container.  </li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Served-with\"><a href=\"#Served-with\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Served with\"></a>Served with</h2><ul>\n<li><a href=\"/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/\">Rice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/tags/dal/\">Dal</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"title":"Doodh Cha | Spiced Milk Tea","description":"The Bengali version of the famous masala chai, or tea steeped milk flavoured with cardamom, ginger and spices","thumbnailImagePosition":"top","thumbnailImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1481780304/doodh-cha-thumbnail_gnjof3.jpg","coverMeta":"out","coverSize":"partial","videoId":"ntigmnhKrAY","date":"2017-01-05T17:00:00.000Z","jsonLd":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Recipe","name":"Doodh Cha","author":"Bong Eats","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1481780300/doodh-cha-thumbnail-small_csecpb.jpg","description":"A sweet, milky, aromatic concoction steeped with orange pekoe tea","prepTime":"PT10M","totalTime":"PT20M","recipeYield":"2 mugs","recipeIngredient":["300 g  Milk","300 g Water","8 g Ginger","1 piece Clove","1 piece Cardamom","25 g  Sugar","8 g Orange pekoe tea"],"recipeInstructions":["1.

Grown in vast quantities in paddy fields across the region, rice is eaten in various forms—boiled, steamed, puffed, or beaten. While the keeper of the Bengali kitchen might break out the precious _gobindobhog_ for _polao_, _payesh_, or _khichuri_, and the _basmati_ for _biryani_, it is the _sheddho chal_, or parboiled rice, that is piled onto plates daily. _Sheddho chal_ is named after the technique used to separate the grain from the husk. This process is said to enhance the nutritional profile of the rice and make it easier to digest.\n\nThere is something extremely satisfying in sitting down to a meal before a plate of perfectly cooked, non-sticky, pearly-white, fluffy rice. While there are innumerable ways of boiling rice and there appears to be no set formula, keeping a few things in mind is useful. (1) Washing the rice thoroughly and repeatedly helps get rid of the starch that usually contributes to its stickiness. (2) Rice, like pasta, must be boiled in a large pot of water. The water must measure at least 5 times in volume than the volume of uncooked rice. Doing so dilutes the starch and ensures that most of it gets drained out at the end, along with the water. (3) Once the rice is cooked to the desired softness, use a large strainer to remove the excess water. Letting the rice sit in the boiled, starchy water (or not draining off as much of the liquid as possible) will yield a sticky, mushy end product. (4) Sometimes, the iron content in the water tends to produce yellowish rice. For fluffy, white rice, you may add a tablespoon of vinegar or a teaspoon of _fitkari_ (alum) to the boiling pot. (5) Finally, as for boiling time, it will depend on the rice and water you use. Ours usually takes about 25 minutes. We highly recommend that you determine the cooking time for _your_ rice. Once you've done that, set a timer whenever you put a pot to boil. When the timer goes off, all you need to do is drain out the water, and you have perfectly cooked rice every single time.      \n\n***\n\n**TIME TAKEN** 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the rice and water you use\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient         |\n|----------|--------------------|\n|    1 cup | Rice               |\n|   5 cups | Water              |\n|   1 tbsp | Vinegar (optional) |\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot | saucepan\n- Lid for the boiling vessel\n- Large strainer | colander\n\n## Appliance\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1.

While there are innumerable ways of boiling rice and there appears to be no set formula, keeping a few things in mind is useful. (1) Washing the rice thoroughly and repeatedly helps get rid of the starch that usually contributes to its stickiness. (2) Rice, like pasta, must be boiled in a large pot of water. The water must measure at least 5 times in volume than the volume of uncooked rice. Doing so dilutes the starch and ensures that most of it gets drained out at the end, along with the water. (3) Once the rice is cooked to the desired softness, use a large strainer to remove the excess water. Letting the rice sit in the boiled, starchy water (or not draining off as much of the liquid as possible) will yield a sticky, mushy end product. (4) Sometimes, the iron content in the water tends to produce yellowish rice. For fluffy, white rice, you may add a tablespoon of vinegar or a teaspoon of _fitkari_ (alum) to the boiling pot. (5) Finally, as for boiling time, it will depend on the rice and water you use. Ours usually takes about 25 minutes. We highly recommend that you determine the cooking time for _your_ rice. Once you've done that, set a timer whenever you put a pot to boil. When the timer goes off, all you need to do is drain out the water, and you have perfectly cooked rice every single time.      \n\n***\n\n**TIME TAKEN** 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the rice and water you use\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient         |\n|----------|--------------------|\n|    1 cup | Rice               |\n|   5 cups | Water              |\n|   1 tbsp | Vinegar (optional) |\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot | saucepan\n- Lid for the boiling vessel\n- Large strainer | colander\n\n## Appliance\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1.

Also known as the climbing perch fish because of its ability _climb_ out of water and walk on land for short distances, _koi machh_ is _always_ bought live at fish markets. It has an extremely slippery exterior, making the use of ash rather necessary while handling the fish for cleaning. Even if the _koi machh_ is scaled, degilled, and cleaned by your fish-seller, it might still be quite slimy to the touch. At home, you may need to rub the fish against an abrasive surface to get rid of the slipperiness (a perforated, steel colander-plate does this job quite well).\n\nComing to this recipe, its main ingredients, _koi machh_ and _phulkopi_ (cauliflower), are fried separately to enhance their flavours, and then added to the delicious _jhol_. The _jhol_ itself is a hot, gingery, _garam-masala_-infused curry that is mildly sweet, but never too spicy. It uplifts the taste of anything it gets soaked up in—potatoes, cauliflower, _bori_, or the fish. Eaten with a generous helping of steaming hot rice, this dish, the _phulkopi diye koi machh’er jhol_ is the Bengali’s favourite fish curry for the winter months.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 40 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|                         Quantity | Ingredient                        |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                             30 g | Mustard oil (for frying)          |\n|                             10 g | Mustard oil (for cooking)         |\n|              350 g (or 5 pieces) | Koi machh (climbing perch fish)   |\n|              150 g (or 5 pieces) | Cauliflower (5-cm florets)        |\n|              100 g (or 5 pieces) | Potatoes (cut lengthwise)         |\n|                        10 pieces | Dal’er bori                       |\n|                             20 g | Tomato (3-cm quarters)                |\n|                            ¼ tsp | Cumin seeds (whole)               |\n|                            2 pcs | Cardamom (whole)                  |\n|                          1 piece | Cinnamon (whole)                  |\n|                          1 piece | Bay leaf                          |\n|                         4 pieces | Green chillies (slit)             |\n|                              7 g | Ginger paste                      |\n|                             15 g | Cumin powder                      |\n|  4 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating) | Turmeric powder                   |\n|                              1 g | Red chilli powder                 |\n| 18 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating) | Salt                              |\n|                             15 g | Sugar                             |\n|                            350 g | Water (hot)                       |\n|                              6 g | Coriander leaves (finely chopped) |\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- Lid for the cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE INGREDIENTS**\n1. Smear the _koi machh_ with ¾ tsp each of salt and turmeric till they are evenly coated. Set them aside.\n2. Cut a cauliflower into chunky florets, about 5 cm large. Take as many florets as there are pieces of fish (in this case, five).\n3. Peel and cut the potatoes lengthwise. Again, we need as many pieces of potatoes as there are fish.\n4. Chop the tomato into 3-cm quarters.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE _BORI_, CAULIFLOWER, AND FISH**\n1. Heat a _kadai_ till it is completely hot. Drizzle 30 g mustard oil into the pan till it starts smoking lightly, and changes colour from deep to pale yellow.\n2. Add all the _dal’er bori_ into the oil and fry them till they are golden. This should take about 15–20 seconds. The bori tend to brown quickly, so stay on the watch.\n3. Remove the fried _bori_ from the pan and set aside.\n4. Now, add the cauliflower florets, along with ¼ tsp of salt, to the pan and fry them till they develop a light-brown colour. This should take about 4 minutes in all.\n5. Remove the cauliflower from the pan and set aside.\n6. Finally, add the marinated _koi machh_ to the same oil, one at a time, and fry them for no longer than a minute on each side. This is a freshwater fish with delicate flavours. So be sure not to sear the fish too long.\n7. Remove the fish from the pan and set aside.\n8. You now have fried _bori_, fried cauliflower, and fried fish ready for use at a later stage, and can now move on to the preparation of the curry.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING THE _JHOL_**\n1. At this point, inspect the oil in your pan. If it looks too burnt, replace it with 10 g of fresh mustard oil. If it is alright, use the same oil to cook the curry in as it contains all the flavour from the fried fish.\n2. Temper the oil, set on medium heat, with the bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin seeds, and 2 slit green chillies.\n3. Add the potatoes to the pan and fry them, with the lid on, for 4 minutes.\n4. While the potatoes are frying, make a paste by combining cumin powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, salt, sugar, and 50 g water.\n5. Add this mixture into the pan and fry it, with lid on, till the water dries up.\n6. Now, add in the ginger paste and the tomatoes, and incorporate them with the spices. Introduce another 50 g water to the pan and sauté the spices again till the water dries off.\n7. The key here is to cover and cook because, alongside sautéing the spices, we also want to allow time for the potatoes to become tender.\n8. Add in the fried cauliflower florets, fold them into the spices, and cook them for a minute or so.\n9. Now, add 350 g of hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n10. Once it comes to a boil, add in the fried _bori_, fried fish, and two (more) of the slit green chillies.\n11. Using a spoon, gently try and submerge the fish in the curry. Be delicate as the fish is quite fragile at this stage.\n12. Cover the pan and allow the curry to simmer for about 6 minutes.\n13. Chop fresh coriander and add it to the pan.

Also known as the climbing perch fish because of its ability <em>climb</em> out of water and walk on land for short distances, <em>koi machh</em> is <em>always</em> bought live at fish markets. It has an extremely slippery exterior, making the use of ash rather necessary while handling the fish for cleaning. Even if the <em>koi machh</em> is scaled, degilled, and cleaned by your fish-seller, it might still be quite slimy to the touch. At home, you may need to rub the fish against an abrasive surface to get rid of the slipperiness (a perforated, steel colander-plate does this job quite well).</p>\n<p>Coming to this recipe, its main ingredients, <em>koi machh</em> and <em>phulkopi</em> (cauliflower), are fried separately to enhance their flavours, and then added to the delicious <em>jhol</em>. The <em>jhol</em> itself is a hot, gingery, <em>garam-masala</em>-infused curry that is mildly sweet, but never too spicy. It uplifts the taste of anything it gets soaked up in—potatoes, cauliflower, <em>bori</em>, or the fish.

It differs from other stuffed _porotas_ in that filling cooks inside the _porota_, and that it is layered.\n\n_Mughlai porota_ can be made at home with a little bit of organisation. Plan for the following elements individually, and in this order:</p>\n1. **The _keema_**—This is an important component of the filling. We like to use cooked mutton or beef _keema_ (minced meat sautéed with onions, ginger, garlic, green chillies, turmeric, and _garam masala_). It needs to be prepared in advance.\n2. **The dough**—This will form the pastry within which the filling is enclosed. Be sure to knead the flour and set it to rest for at least 30 minutes.\n3. **The filling**—While your dough is resting, use this time to chop the onions, green chillies, ginger, and fresh coriander. Toast some peanuts and roughly crush them. Get the bread crumbs and salt out. Beat an egg in a bowl along with all the ingredients and your filling is ready to go!\n4. **The sides**—_Mughlai porota_ is served with a cabin-style salad of cucumber, onion, and beet, _alu'r torkari_, chicken or mutton _kosha_, and some ketchup. If you want some or all of these sides, be sure to prepare them before your start making the _mughlai_.\n5. **The _Mughlai porota_**—Now that the filling has been prepared, the sides are organised, and the dough has had time to rest, we are ready to bring all these elements together.

We like to use cooked mutton or beef <em>keema</em> (minced meat sautéed with onions, ginger, garlic, green chillies, turmeric, and <em>garam masala</em>). It needs to be prepared in advance.</li>\n<li><strong>The dough</strong>—This will form the pastry within which the filling is enclosed. Be sure to knead the flour and set it to rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>The filling</strong>—While your dough is resting, use this time to chop the onions, green chillies, ginger, and fresh coriander.

It is sweet to the taste, flaky, and delicately flavoured. To top it all off, it is also extremely easy to eat, as it contains no bones besides the central skeleton. This recipe, _pabda machh’er tel jhol_, is a delicacy in Bengali cooking. ‘_Tel jhol_’ is the name given to a light curry, which is infused with _kaalo jeere_, green chillies, and mustard oil. Because it is sparsely spiced, this style of curry doesn’t overpower the star ingredient—the fish—but lets it shine on its own. If you have managed to procure a batch of fresh _pabda_, this should be your go-to _jhol_.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 30 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|                               Quantity | Ingredient                        |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                                  450 g | Pabda machh (cut and cleaned)     |\n|                                   35 g | Mustard oil (for frying)          |\n|                                    7 g | Mustard oil (for cooking)         |\n|                                    7 g | Mustard oil (for garnish)         |\n|                                ¼ tsp   | Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)       |\n|                               5 pieces | Green chillies (slit)             |\n|                                   25 g | Tomato (roughly chopped)          |\n|                              10 pieces | Dal’er bori                       |\n|                                  100 g | Brinjal (5-cm segments)           |\n| 15 g (plus ¾ tsp extra for marinating) | Salt                              |\n|  6 g (plus ¾ tsp extra for marinating) | Turmeric powder                   |\n|                                  ½ tsp | Atta (flour)                      |\n|                                    8 g | Coriander leaves (finely chopped) |\n|                                  400 g | Warm water                        |\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Electric kettle (optional)\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE INGREDIENTS**\n1. Smear the cut and cleaned _padba machh_ with ¾ tsp turmeric powder, ¾ tsp salt, and 1 tsp mustard oil. Mix till the fish are well coated, and set aside.\n2. Cut the brinjal into 5-cm segments. We need as many pieces of brinjal as there are fish—in this case, five.\n3. Roughly chop the tomatoes.\n4. Slit the green chillies.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE _BORI_, BRINJAL, AND FISH**\n1. Heat your _kadai_ well and add 35 g mustard oil to the pan.\n2. Once the oil is completely hot (that is, once it has begun to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow), add the _dal’er bori_.\n3. Fry the _boris_ for about 20 seconds till they are golden brown. They colour very quickly, so be alert while frying them.\n4. Remove the _boris_ from the oil and set aside.\n5. Next, add the brinjal pieces to the oil.\n6. Stir-fry for about 4 minutes till they are golden. Remove them from the oil and set aside.\n7. Now, in batches, fry the marinated fish. Fresh, sweetwater fish such as the _pabda_ do not need heavy searing. Fry them lightly to preserve their delicate flavour. A minute on each side should do the job.\n8. Remove the fried fish on a plate and reserve for later use.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING THE _JHOL_**\n1. Before we start, make a paste with 15 g salt, 6 g turmeric powder, and 50 g water. Mix and keep ready.\n2. Heat 7 g mustard oil in the _kadai_. (If the oil that you fried the fish in is not burnt, you may use the same oil to prepare the _jhol_.)\n3. Add the _kaalo jeere_, tomatoes, and 3 green chillies to the oil.\n4. Fry them for a minute on medium heat.\n5. Add the turmeric and salt mixture to the pan, and fry till the water in the spice mix dries up.\n6. Now, pour 400 g of hot water (either heated in an electric kettle or on the stove) into the pan. This will form the curry.\n7. Once the curry starts to simmer, add in the fried _boris_.\n8. Simmer for another 2 minutes before lowering in the _pabda machh_, one by one. Also add the fish drippings that might have collected on the plate that held the fried fish; they are delicious.\n9. Add the fried brinjal to the curry.\n10. Let everything bubble for about 5 minutes. As the curry boils, you will notice that the colour of the _jhol_ has changed from deep yellow to bright yellow. That’s when you know that the turmeric is cooked, and that the curry won’t taste of the raw spice.\n11. Now, pick one of the softened green chillies from the curry onto a small bowl. Add ½ tsp _atta_ to it, along with 1 tbsp of water. Mash the three together, until paste-like.\n12. Add this mixture to the _jhol_. The mashed green chilli will release the heat, while the flour will help the curry thicken and develop body.\n13. Garnish with 2 more slit green chillies, a drizzle of mustard oil (about 7 g), and chopped coriander.\n14. Allow everything to bubble for a couple of more minutes, before turning off the heat.\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n","source":"_posts/pabda-machher-tel-jhol.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Pabda Machh'er Tel Jhol\ntags:\n  - fish\n  - pabda machh\n  - non-vegetarian\ndescription: >-\n  A light, hearty, delicious delicacy, the padba macher tel jhol is packed with\n  the flavours of Bengal’s prized sweetwater pabda fish.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1487900313/pabda-mach-website-thumbnail_hwdrvo.jpg\ncoverImageUrl: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1487900313/pabda-mach-website-thumbnail_hwdrvo.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: AMfGfjhJFNM\ndate: 2017-02-23 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Pabda Machh'er Tel Jhol\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1487900313/pabda-mach-thumbnail-small_ddzr4v.jpg\",\"description\":\"A light, hearty, delicious delicacy, the padba macher tel jhol is packed with the flavours of Bengal’s prized sweetwater pabda fish.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT15M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT30M\",\"recipeYield\":\"5 servings\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"450 g  Pabda machh (cut and cleaned)\",\"35 g  Mustard oil (for frying)\",\"7 g  Mustard oil (for cooking)\",\"7 g  Mustard oil (for garnish)\",\"¼ tsp  Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)\",\"5 pieces  Green chillies (slit)\",\"25 g  Tomato (roughly chopped)\",\"10 pieces  Dal’er bori\",\"100 g  Brinjal (5-cm segments)\",\"15 g (plus ¾ tsp extra for marinating)  Salt\",\"6 g (plus ¾ tsp extra for marinating)  Turmeric powder\",\"½ tsp  Atta (flour)\",\"8 g  Coriander leaves (finely chopped)\",\"400 g  Warm water\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

Smear the cut and cleaned _padba machh_ with ¾ tsp turmeric powder, ¾ tsp salt, and 1 tsp mustard oil. Mix till the fish are well coated, and set aside.\n2. Cut the brinjal into 5-cm segments. We need as many pieces of brinjal as there are fish—in this case, five.\n3. Roughly chop the tomatoes.\n4. Slit the green chillies.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE _BORI_, BRINJAL, AND FISH**\n1. Heat your _kadai_ well and add 35 g mustard oil to the pan.\n2. Once the oil is completely hot (that is, once it has begun to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow), add the _dal’er bori_.\n3. Fry the _boris_ for about 20 seconds till they are golden brown. They colour very quickly, so be alert while frying them.\n4. Remove the _boris_ from the oil and set aside.\n5. Next, add the brinjal pieces to the oil.\n6. Stir-fry for about 4 minutes till they are golden. Remove them from the oil and set aside.\n7. Now, in batches, fry the marinated fish. Fresh, sweetwater fish such as the _pabda_ do not need heavy searing. Fry them lightly to preserve their delicate flavour. A minute on each side should do the job.\n8. Remove the fried fish on a plate and reserve for later use.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING THE _JHOL_**\n1. Before we start, make a paste with 15 g salt, 6 g turmeric powder, and 50 g water. Mix and keep ready.\n2. Heat 7 g mustard oil in the _kadai_. (If the oil that you fried the fish in is not burnt, you may use the same oil to prepare the _jhol_.)\n3. Add the _kaalo jeere_, tomatoes, and 3 green chillies to the oil.\n4. Fry them for a minute on medium heat.\n5. Add the turmeric and salt mixture to the pan, and fry till the water in the spice mix dries up.\n6. Now, pour 400 g of hot water (either heated in an electric kettle or on the stove) into the pan. This will form the curry.\n7. Once the curry starts to simmer, add in the fried _boris_.\n8. Simmer for another 2 minutes before lowering in the _pabda machh_, one by one. Also add the fish drippings that might have collected on the plate that held the fried fish; they are delicious.\n9. Add the fried brinjal to the curry.\n10. Let everything bubble for about 5 minutes. As the curry boils, you will notice that the colour of the _jhol_ has changed from deep yellow to bright yellow. That’s when you know that the turmeric is cooked, and that the curry won’t taste of the raw spice.\n11. Now, pick one of the softened green chillies from the curry onto a small bowl. Add ½ tsp _atta_ to it, along with 1 tbsp of water. Mash the three together, until paste-like.\n12. Add this mixture to the _jhol_. The mashed green chilli will release the heat, while the flour will help the curry thicken and develop body.\n13. Garnish with 2 more slit green chillies, a drizzle of mustard oil (about 7 g), and chopped coriander.\n14. Allow everything to bubble for a couple of more minutes, before turning off the heat.\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n","slug":"pabda-machher-tel-jhol","published":1,"updated":"2017-03-03T06:15:31.816Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cj0381pv40019usvhurlw2q4n","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A flavourful, light curry with <em>pabda</em> fish</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">It is unbelievable that something with a handful of ingredients can taste so divine.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">T</span>he <em>pabda machh</em> is one of the most beloved of Bengal’s fishes.

What this typically involves is heating up the oil (usually mustard oil), and once hot, adding a selection of whole spices to it. This 'tempers' the oil, transferring the flavours of the spices to it. This might seem like a tiny, inconsequential step (the process of tempering doesn’t take more than a few seconds), but no Bengali cook has ever skipped it. Is is what prepares the oil for cooking. In many cases, the choice of _phoron_ defines the flavour profile of the recipe (think of a dish like [_panchmishali torkari_](/recipe/panchmishali-torkari/), or a fish curry like _tel jhol_). There are myriad combinations of spices used for _phoron_ in Bengali cooking, and while that is subject for another post, here we look at the most definitive of Bengali tempering spices—the _panch phoron_.\n\n_Panch phoron_ literally means five spices used for tempering. Apart from the Bengali cuisine, variations of this spice mix are used in Assamese, Oriya, and Nepali cooking as well. The Bengali version comprises _mouri_ (fennel seeds), _methi_ (fenugreek seeds), _kaalo jeere_ (nigella seeds), _shorshe_ (mustard seeds), and a typically Bengali spice, called _radhuni_. If you can’t find _radhuni_ where you live, cumin seeds make an acceptable substitute.\n\nThe _panch phoron_ is used like any other _phoron_. You heat up the mustard oil thoroughly, till it starts to smoke lightly and turns pale yellow in colour. You then add as much _panch phoron_ as the recipe calls for to the oil. The spices will start cracking immediately (mostly because of the mustard seeds in the mix) and give out a distinctive, bitter-sweet-anisey aroma. However, watch the _methi_ in the mix carefully; it tends to redden, burn quite easily, and turn bitter. So, always have the next ingredient in line prepped and ready, to add to the pan, and bring down the temperature of the oil.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 5 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 50 g of _panch phoron_\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                  |\n|----------|-----------------------------|\n|   1 tbsp | mouri (fennel seeds)        |\n|   1 tbsp | methi (fenugreek seeds)     |\n|   1 tbsp | kaalo jeere (nigella seeds) |\n|   1 tbsp | shorshe (mustard seeds)     |\n|   1 tbsp | radhuni                     |\n\n## Equipment\n- A small storage container\n\n## Method\nMix all the whole spices together in equal proportions and store in an airtight container.\n\n## Used to\n- Temper [dals](/tags/dal/)\n- Temper vegetarian dishes such as the delicious [panchmishali torkari](/recipe/panchmishali-torkari/)\n- Temper chutneys\n- Flavour pickles\n","source":"_posts/panch-phoron.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Panch Phoron\ntags:\n  - how-to\n  - masala\n  - vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\ndescription: >-\n  Easy-to-make, authentic, Bengali five-spice tempering mix, using fennel seeds,\n  fenugreek seeds, mustard seeds, nigella seeds, and radhuni.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1487297456/panchphoron-website-thumbnail-_kn9yqk.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: gNj33BZYcPs\ndate: 2017-02-16 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Panch Phoron\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1487297456/panchphoron-thumbnail-small-_gcah1e.jpg\",\"description\":\"A Bengali five-spice mix for tempering oil\",\"prepTime\":\"PT5M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT5M\",\"recipeYield\":\"50 g of panch phoron\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"1 tbsp  mouri (fennel seeds)\",\"1 tbsp  methi (fenugreek seeds)\",\"1 tbsp  kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)\",\"1 tbsp  shorshe (mustard seeds)\",\"1 tbsp  radhuni\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"Mix all the whole spices together in equal proportions and store in an airtight container.\"]}\n---\n\n\n<p class=\"post-byline\">Bengali five-spice mix for tempering oil</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">_Panch phoron_ is popularly used to temper dals, vegetables (such as [_panchmishali torkari_](/recipe/panchmishali-torkari/) or _shada alu’r torkari_), _chutneys_ (those with tomatoes or raw mangoes), or _achaars_ (such as raw-mango pickles).</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">T</span>he cooking of most Bengali dishes starts with the _phoron_.

In many cases, the choice of _phoron_ defines the flavour profile of the recipe (think of a dish like [_panchmishali torkari_](/recipe/panchmishali-torkari/), or a fish curry like _tel jhol_). There are myriad combinations of spices used for _phoron_ in Bengali cooking, and while that is subject for another post, here we look at the most definitive of Bengali tempering spices—the _panch phoron_.\n\n_Panch phoron_ literally means five spices used for tempering. Apart from the Bengali cuisine, variations of this spice mix are used in Assamese, Oriya, and Nepali cooking as well. The Bengali version comprises _mouri_ (fennel seeds), _methi_ (fenugreek seeds), _kaalo jeere_ (nigella seeds), _shorshe_ (mustard seeds), and a typically Bengali spice, called _radhuni_. If you can’t find _radhuni_ where you live, cumin seeds make an acceptable substitute.\n\nThe _panch phoron_ is used like any other _phoron_. You heat up the mustard oil thoroughly, till it starts to smoke lightly and turns pale yellow in colour. You then add as much _panch phoron_ as the recipe calls for to the oil. The spices will start cracking immediately (mostly because of the mustard seeds in the mix) and give out a distinctive, bitter-sweet-anisey aroma. However, watch the _methi_ in the mix carefully; it tends to redden, burn quite easily, and turn bitter. So, always have the next ingredient in line prepped and ready, to add to the pan, and bring down the temperature of the oil.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 5 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 50 g of _panch phoron_\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                  |\n|----------|-----------------------------|\n|   1 tbsp | mouri (fennel seeds)        |\n|   1 tbsp | methi (fenugreek seeds)     |\n|   1 tbsp | kaalo jeere (nigella seeds) |\n|   1 tbsp | shorshe (mustard seeds)     |\n|   1 tbsp | radhuni                     |\n\n## Equipment\n- A small storage container\n\n## Method\nMix all the whole spices together in equal proportions and store in an airtight container.\n\n## Used to\n- Temper [dals](/tags/dal/)\n- Temper vegetarian dishes such as the delicious [panchmishali torkari](/recipe/panchmishali-torkari/)\n- Temper chutneys\n- Flavour pickles\n","slug":"panch-phoron","published":1,"updated":"2017-03-03T06:15:27.029Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cj0381pv6001dusvh16fo8cl0","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">Bengali five-spice mix for tempering oil</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\"><em>Panch phoron</em> is popularly used to temper dals, vegetables (such as <a href=\"/recipe/panchmishali-torkari/\"><em>panchmishali torkari</em></a> or <em>shada alu’r torkari</em>), <em>chutneys</em> (those with tomatoes or raw mangoes), or <em>achaars</em> (such as raw-mango pickles).</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">T</span>he cooking of most Bengali dishes starts with the <em>phoron</em>.

This is not a preparation in which you spice up things with ginger or cumin powder or red chilli powder. The only spice this recipe calls for is a touch of turmeric. Mostly, it relies on the salt and sugar to help draw out the moisture from the vegetables, and allow their flavours to mingle while cooked together. We don’t add water to form a gravy. Rather we cook this _torkari_ on low heat, with the lid on, for nearly 30 to 40 minutes. At the end of this slow cooking process, it reaches a state where no vegetable stands out, yet each has still held on to its flavours and integrity.\n\nComing to the selection of the veggies themselves, some type of starchy item such as a potato or sweet potato is used. These, being otherwise neutral in taste, are the perfect receptacle of the juices from the other vegetables. The mushy texture is usually contributed by pumpkin, while radish is used for the more sharper notes. Some kind of beans (such as _borboti_ or _sheem_) add crunch and colour. In the winter months, cauliflower lends the most sublime flavour to the _torkari_, in addition to providing texture. Finally, slimier vegetables such as brinjals, or cabbage or leafy greens that are prone to wilting on application of heat and salt, coat the mix with their juices and hold everything together.\n\nThere are several versions of _panchmishali torkari_. The choice of _phoron_ (or tempering) will depend on the vegetables used. In this particular recipe, we are using potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_ (yardlong beans), cabbage, and brinjal, with a tempering of _panch phoron_.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 60 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|               Quantity | Ingredient                                |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **OIL**                |                                           |\n|                   40 g | Mustard oil                               |\n| **TEMPERING (PHORON)** |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Bay leaves (whole)                        |\n|               2 pieces | Dried red chillies (whole)                |\n|                1 piece | Green chilli (slit)                       |\n|                  1 tsp | Panch phoron                              |\n| **THE VEGETABLES**     |                                           |\n|                  100 g | Brinjals (5-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  200 g | Potatoes (4-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  100 g | Sweet potatoes (4-cm cubes)               |\n|                  200 g | Pumpkin (4-cm cubes)                      |\n|                  200 g | Cauliflower (5-cm florets)                |\n|                  100 g | Borboti or yardlong beans (5-cm segments) |\n|                  100 g | Cabbage (5-cm segments)                   |\n| **THE SEASONING**      |                                           |\n|                  ½ tsp | Turmeric powder                           |\n|                   12 g | Salt                                      |\n|                   25 g | Sugar                                     |\n| **THE GARNISH**        |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Green chillies (slit)                     |\n|                   10 g | Coriander leaves (chopped)                |\n|                  ½ tsp | Bhaja masala                              |\n|                    5 g | Ghee                                      |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- Lid for the cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Peel and cut the potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin in 4 cm cubes.\n2. Cut the _borboti_, brinjal, and cabbage in segments of 5 cm each.\n3. Cut the cauliflower in florets, 5 cm large.\n4. In order to cook _panchmishali torkari_, the vegetables are stir-fried, and the order in which they are added to the pan depends upon their hardness. So, the potatoes and sweet potatoes, which are the hardest of all the veggies, are the first to enter the pan, followed by pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_, and cabbage. We deal with the brinjals separately, as explained in the next step.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Heat mustard oil in a pan till it starts to smoke lightly and the pungent smell is gone.\n2. Keeping the pan on medium heat, add in the brinjals and fry them for about 3 minutes till they are golden.\n3. Remove them from pan and reserve for later use. Frying the brinjals separately enhances their flavour.\n4. Now, in the same oil, add the tempering of dried red chillies, bay leaves, green chilli, and _panch phoron_. _Panch phoron_ is a mix of the following whole spices in equal proportion: fenugreek seeds (_methi_), fennel seeds (_mouri_), mustard seeds (_shorshe_), nigella seeds (_kaalo jeere_), and a typically Bengali spice called _radhuni_.\n5. Once the spices start to crackle, add in the potatoes and sweet potatoes to the oil.\n6. Fry these for about 3 minutes before introducing the next vegetable, that is, pumpkin.\n7. Fry the pumpkin, sweet potatoes, and potatoes together for another 3 minutes before adding the cauliflower. Basically, at intervals of 3 minutes, we add the next vegetable and stir-fry it together with the veggies already in the pan.\n8. Once the cauliflower is fried, add the _borboti_, and then, after 3 minutes, the cabbage.\n\n**STEP III—STEAMING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Once all the veggies have been fried, add in the salt and turmeric, and stir them in.\n2. At this point, lower the heat and cover the pan with a lid. The salt will help release the moisture from the vegetables, and gently steaming them with the lid on will help soften them up.\n3. Cook the vegetables like this for about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan. While doing so, be gentle, as the we don’t want the vegetables to turn into mush. (Always use a folding motion to stir the veggies around.)\n4. After 15 minutes, add the sugar and the fried brinjals, and cover and cook for another 10 minutes or so, stirring occasionally.\n5. You will know that the _torkari_ is done when the vegetables are completely tender and have integrated themselves into the dish, but still have the integrity to not fall apart to the touch.\n6. At this point, garnish with the chopped coriander leaves, green chillies, _bhaja masala_, and _ghee_.\n7. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and allow it to rest for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | Roti\n","source":"_posts/panchmishali-torkari.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Panchmishali Torkari\ndescription: Video recipe of authentic, vegetarian Bengali dish of cauliflower, beans, sweet potatoes, eggplants, cooked with panch phoron tempering.\ntags:\n  - vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\n  - torkari\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1485389957/website-thumbnail-panchmishalitorkari_t7jruj.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: DWY8qtUC9K0\ndate: 2017-01-26 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Panchmishali Torkari\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1485389957/thumbnail-small-panchmishalitorkari_pexgac.jpg\",\"description\":\"Panchmishali torkari is any Bengali mixed-vegetable preparation, in which the vegetables are first stir-fried and then steamed in their own juices till they are tender and well-integrated.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT20M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT60M\",\"recipeYield\":\"5 servings\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"40 g  Mustard oil\",\"2 pieces  Bay leaves (whole)\",\"2 pieces  Dried red chillies (whole)\",\"1 piece  Green chilli (slit)\",\"1 tsp  Panch phoron\",\"100 g  Brinjals (5-cm cubes)\",\"200 g  Potatoes (4-cm cubes)\",\"100 g  Sweet potatoes (4-cm cubes)\",\"200 g  Pumpkin (4-cm cubes)\",\"200 g  Cauliflower (5-cm florets)\",\"100 g  Borboti or yardlong beans (5-cm segments)\",\"100 g  Cabbage (5-cm segments)\",\"½ tsp  Turmeric powder\",\"12 g  Salt\",\"25 g  Sugar\",\"2 pieces  Green chillies (slit)\",\"10 g  Coriander leaves (chopped)\",\"½ tsp  Bhaja masala\",\"5 g  Ghee\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

This is not a preparation in which you spice up things with ginger or cumin powder or red chilli powder. The only spice this recipe calls for is a touch of turmeric. Mostly, it relies on the salt and sugar to help draw out the moisture from the vegetables, and allow their flavours to mingle while cooked together. We don’t add water to form a gravy. Rather we cook this _torkari_ on low heat, with the lid on, for nearly 30 to 40 minutes. At the end of this slow cooking process, it reaches a state where no vegetable stands out, yet each has still held on to its flavours and integrity.\n\nComing to the selection of the veggies themselves, some type of starchy item such as a potato or sweet potato is used. These, being otherwise neutral in taste, are the perfect receptacle of the juices from the other vegetables. The mushy texture is usually contributed by pumpkin, while radish is used for the more sharper notes. Some kind of beans (such as _borboti_ or _sheem_) add crunch and colour. In the winter months, cauliflower lends the most sublime flavour to the _torkari_, in addition to providing texture. Finally, slimier vegetables such as brinjals, or cabbage or leafy greens that are prone to wilting on application of heat and salt, coat the mix with their juices and hold everything together.\n\nThere are several versions of _panchmishali torkari_. The choice of _phoron_ (or tempering) will depend on the vegetables used. In this particular recipe, we are using potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_ (yardlong beans), cabbage, and brinjal, with a tempering of _panch phoron_.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 60 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|               Quantity | Ingredient                                |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **OIL**                |                                           |\n|                   40 g | Mustard oil                               |\n| **TEMPERING (PHORON)** |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Bay leaves (whole)                        |\n|               2 pieces | Dried red chillies (whole)                |\n|                1 piece | Green chilli (slit)                       |\n|                  1 tsp | Panch phoron                              |\n| **THE VEGETABLES**     |                                           |\n|                  100 g | Brinjals (5-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  200 g | Potatoes (4-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  100 g | Sweet potatoes (4-cm cubes)               |\n|                  200 g | Pumpkin (4-cm cubes)                      |\n|                  200 g | Cauliflower (5-cm florets)                |\n|                  100 g | Borboti or yardlong beans (5-cm segments) |\n|                  100 g | Cabbage (5-cm segments)                   |\n| **THE SEASONING**      |                                           |\n|                  ½ tsp | Turmeric powder                           |\n|                   12 g | Salt                                      |\n|                   25 g | Sugar                                     |\n| **THE GARNISH**        |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Green chillies (slit)                     |\n|                   10 g | Coriander leaves (chopped)                |\n|                  ½ tsp | Bhaja masala                              |\n|                    5 g | Ghee                                      |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- Lid for the cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Peel and cut the potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin in 4 cm cubes.\n2. Cut the _borboti_, brinjal, and cabbage in segments of 5 cm each.\n3. Cut the cauliflower in florets, 5 cm large.\n4. In order to cook _panchmishali torkari_, the vegetables are stir-fried, and the order in which they are added to the pan depends upon their hardness. So, the potatoes and sweet potatoes, which are the hardest of all the veggies, are the first to enter the pan, followed by pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_, and cabbage. We deal with the brinjals separately, as explained in the next step.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Heat mustard oil in a pan till it starts to smoke lightly and the pungent smell is gone.\n2. Keeping the pan on medium heat, add in the brinjals and fry them for about 3 minutes till they are golden.\n3. Remove them from pan and reserve for later use.

Once the spices start to crackle, add in the potatoes and sweet potatoes to the oil.\n6. Fry these for about 3 minutes before introducing the next vegetable, that is, pumpkin.\n7. Fry the pumpkin, sweet potatoes, and potatoes together for another 3 minutes before adding the cauliflower. Basically, at intervals of 3 minutes, we add the next vegetable and stir-fry it together with the veggies already in the pan.\n8. Once the cauliflower is fried, add the _borboti_, and then, after 3 minutes, the cabbage.\n\n**STEP III—STEAMING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Once all the veggies have been fried, add in the salt and turmeric, and stir them in.\n2. At this point, lower the heat and cover the pan with a lid. The salt will help release the moisture from the vegetables, and gently steaming them with the lid on will help soften them up.\n3. Cook the vegetables like this for about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan. While doing so, be gentle, as the we don’t want the vegetables to turn into mush. (Always use a folding motion to stir the veggies around.)\n4. After 15 minutes, add the sugar and the fried brinjals, and cover and cook for another 10 minutes or so, stirring occasionally.\n5. You will know that the _torkari_ is done when the vegetables are completely tender and have integrated themselves into the dish, but still have the integrity to not fall apart to the touch.\n6. At this point, garnish with the chopped coriander leaves, green chillies, _bhaja masala_, and _ghee_.\n7. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and allow it to rest for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | Roti\n","slug":"panchmishali-torkari","published":1,"updated":"2017-03-03T06:15:23.172Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cj0381pvl001musvhkgx84eus","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">Simple Bengali mixed veggies with <em>panch phoron</em> tempering</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\"><em>Panchmishali torkari</em> is any Bengali mixed-vegetable preparation, in which the vegetables are first stir-fried and then steamed in their own juices till they are tender and well-integrated.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">A</span>s you might have guessed, the stars of this dish are the veggies themselves.
