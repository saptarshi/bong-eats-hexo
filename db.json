Weigh out the dal and add it to a dry pot (preferably a kadai or wok), set on medium heat.","2. Dry-roast the dal, stirring continuously, till it changes colour from yellow to a pinkish brown. Here, it is important to keep the dal moving while it is in the pan to ensure that all surfaces of the grains roast evenly. Be particularly alert once the dal has taken on a light, brown colour, as it is during this stage that the dal has the tendency to burn easily.","3. Transfer the roasted dal into a boiling pot immediately (do not hold it in the hot pan, as it will continue to brown when kept in contact with heat).","4. Wash and rinse the dal thoroughly.","5. Add 550 g water to the washed dal.","6. Boil it on medium heat for about 20 minutes. While we want the dal to be completely cooked, we still want the individual grains to remain unbroken. So, check frequently to ensure that the dal doesn’t turn into mush and lose its texture.","7. Chop the cauliflower into 2-cm florets, the carrot into 1-cm cubes, and the tomatoes roughly. Shell the peas and slit the green chillies.","8. Heat up the kadai once more and add 10 g mustard oil.","9. Once the oil has smoked lightly and lost its pungent smell, temper it with the dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, cumin seeds, and 1 green chilli.","10. Add the carrots and stir-fry them for 1 minute.","11. Next, add the cauliflower florets and fry them for another minute.","12. Add the tomatoes and peas, one at a time, and fry them for a minute after each addition.","13. Pour in the roasted, boiled dal with its water.","14. Add the salt, sugar and turmeric, and stir them in.","15. Allow the dal to bubble for about 6 minutes on low heat. Don’t increase the heat level or the liquid in the dal may dry up.","16. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves, a slit green chilli, garam masala powder, and ghee.","17. Cover the pan with a lid and allow the dal to soak up the flavours from the garnish before serving."]},"_content":"\n<p class=\"post-byline\">Roasted dehulled moong dal with fresh, winter veggies</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Bright and colourful, the _shobji diye bhaja moong’er dal_ is bound to floor you with its heady, nutty aroma.</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">W</span>hat makes _bhaja moong'er dal_ the most beloved of all [_dals_](/tags/dal/) is the fact that it is rich and comforting, without being entirely over-the-top.

Weigh out the _dal_ and add it to a dry pot (preferably a _kadai_ or wok), set on medium heat.\n2. Dry-roast the _dal_, stirring continuously, till it changes colour from yellow to a pinkish brown. Here, it is important to keep the _dal_ moving while it is in the pan to ensure that all surfaces of the grains roast evenly. Be particularly alert once the _dal_ has taken on a light, brown colour, as it is during this stage that the _dal_ has the tendency to burn easily.\n3. Transfer the roasted _dal_ into a boiling pot immediately (do not hold it in the hot pan, as it will continue to brown when kept in contact with heat).\n4. Wash and rinse the _dal_ thoroughly.\n5. Add 550 g water to the washed _dal_.\n6. Boil it on medium heat for about 20 minutes. While we want the _dal_ to be completely cooked, we still want the individual grains to remain unbroken. So, check frequently to ensure that the dal doesn’t turn into mush and lose its texture.\n7. Chop the cauliflower into 2-cm florets, the carrot into 1-cm cubes, and the tomatoes roughly. Shell the peas and slit the green chillies.\n8. Heat up the _kadai_ once more and add 10 g mustard oil.\n9. Once the oil has smoked lightly and lost its pungent smell, temper it with the dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, cumin seeds, and 1 green chilli.\n10. Add the carrots and stir-fry them for 1 minute.\n11. Next, add the cauliflower florets and fry them for another minute.\n12. Add the tomatoes and peas, one at a time, and fry them for a minute after each addition.\n13. Pour in the roasted, boiled _dal_ with its water.\n14. Add the salt, sugar and turmeric, and stir them in.\n15. Allow the _dal_ to bubble for about 6 minutes on low heat. Don’t increase the heat level or the liquid in the _dal_ may dry up.\n16. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves, a slit green chilli, [_garam masala_ powder](/recipe/bengali-garam-masala/), and _ghee_.\n17. Cover the pan with a lid and allow the _dal_ to soak up the flavours from the garnish before serving.\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- [Torkari](/tags/torkari/) | [bhaja](/tags/bhaja/) | [alu sheddho](/recipe/alu-sheddho/)\n","source":"_posts/bhaja-moong-dal-shobji-diye.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Bhaja Moong Dal Shobji diye\ndescription: A gorgeous-looking traditional Bengali vegetarian dal with roasted yellow mung beans, simmered with cauliflowers, carrots and peas.\ntags:\n  - vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\n  - dal\n  - moong dal\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1486085841/website-thumbnail-bhaja-moong-dal_mmllfy.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: _7jKLiPOEFo\ndate: 2017-02-02 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Bhaja Moong Dal Shobji diye\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1486085841/thumbnail-small-bhaja-moong-dal_l0srb1.jpg\",\"description\":\"Roasted moong dal with fresh, winter veggies\",\"prepTime\":\"PT15M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT40M\",\"recipeYield\":\"4 servings\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"100 g   Moong dal (split gram)\",\"550 g   Water (for boiling dal)\",\"10 g   Mustard oil\",\"1 piece   Dried red chilli (whole)\",\"1 piece   Bay leaf (whole)\",\"1 piece   Cardamom (whole)\",\"1 piece   Cinnamon (whole)\",\"1 piece   Clove (whole)\",\"¼ tsp   Cumin seeds\",\"2 pieces   Green chillies (slit)\",\"25 g   Carrots (1-cm cubes)\",\"25 g   Cauliflower (2-cm florets)\",\"15 g   Tomatoes (roughly chopped)\",\"15 g   Peas (shelled)\",\"7 g   Salt\",\"15 g   Sugar\",\"¼ tsp   Turmeric powder\",\"10 g   Coriander leaves (finely chopped)\",\"¼ tsp   Garam masala powder\",\"5 g   Ghee\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

Rinse the chhola’r dal well and soak it in water for at least 2 hours. After this time, strain the dal and transfer it to a boiling pot or pressure cooker. Add 700 g water, 6 g salt, and the bay leaves. Boil the dal until it is tender, but the grains are still whole. The texture of this dish will depend a whole lot on how well the dal is boiled. We want each grain of lentil to be perfectly cooked, but not turned to mush. On medium heat, our chhola’r dal cooks to the desired doneness in 2 whistles. The time may vary for you.","2. Before you begin cooking, make a spice slurry by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder and 50 g water. Also, slice the coconut and slit the green chillies.","3. Heat mustard oil in a pan (on medium heat) and once it starts to smoke lightly and changes colour to a pale yellow, add the thinly sliced coconut. Fry until the coconut turns golden brown. This should take about a minute. Remove from the oil and set aside.","4. Temper the same oil with the dried red chillies, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. Stir in the hing, allowing it to fry for about 10 seconds.","5. Add the spice slurry we made earlier to the pan. Fry on medium heat until the raw smell of the spices is gone. This should take about 6 minutes. Add the slit green chillies and raisins, and continue frying until you see oil leaving the sides of the spice mixture.","6. Now add the boiled dal along with the water to the pan. (If you feel there’s a lot of excess water with the dal, reserve some in a bowl.)","7. Add the remaining salt (12 g) and allow the dal to bubble until it thickens (about 6 to 8 minutes). Depending on how soft or hard your dal is, you may have to adjust the flame and water accordingly. For example, if your dal is still slightly hard, boil on low heat, adding water to maintain consistency, until it is cooked. If it is on the softer, mushier side (first of all, you need to make note of where you went wrong and try correcting the boiling time on your next attempt!), turn up the flame to thicken the dal quickly.","8. Pick out a softened green chilli from the dal, mash it with the back of a spoon and add it back to the dal. Add the sugar and bubble for about a minute before stirring in the ghee, Bengali garam masala, and fried coconut. Allow the dal to rest, covered, for 2 minutes before serving."]},"_content":"\n\n\n<p class=\"post-byline\">Savoury-sweet preparation of curried split Bengal gram</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Breakfast, lunch, dinner—this is a dal recipe for all occasions.</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<span class=\"dropcap\">E</span>very family has its own the classic Bengali _cholar dal_ recipe.

Rinse the _chhola’r dal_ well and soak it in water for at least 2 hours. After this time, strain the _dal_ and transfer it to a boiling pot or pressure cooker. Add 700 g water, 6 g salt, and the bay leaves. Boil the _dal_ until it is tender, but the grains are still whole. The texture of this dish will depend a whole lot on how well the _dal_ is boiled. We want each grain of lentil to be perfectly cooked, but not turned to mush. On medium heat, our _chhola’r dal_ cooks to the desired doneness in 2 whistles. The time may vary for you.\n2. Before you begin cooking, make a spice slurry by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder and 50 g water. Also, slice the coconut and slit the green chillies. \n3. Heat mustard oil in a pan (on medium heat) and once it starts to smoke lightly and changes colour to a pale yellow, add the thinly sliced coconut. Fry until the coconut turns golden brown. This should take about a minute. Remove from the oil and set aside. \n4. Temper the same oil with the dried red chillies, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. Stir in the _hing_, allowing it to fry for about 10 seconds. \n5. Add the spice slurry we made earlier to the pan. Fry on medium heat until the raw smell of the spices is gone. This should take about 6 minutes. Add the slit green chillies and raisins, and continue frying until you see oil leaving the sides of the spice mixture. \n6. Now add the boiled _dal_ along with the water to the pan. (If you feel there’s a lot of excess water with the _dal_, reserve some in a bowl.) \n7. Add the remaining salt (12 g) and allow the _dal_ to bubble until it thickens (about 6 to 8 minutes). Depending on how soft or hard your _dal_ is, you may have to adjust the flame and water accordingly. For example, if your _dal_ is still slightly hard, boil on low heat, adding water to maintain consistency, until it is cooked. If it is on the softer, mushier side (first of all, you need to make note of where you went wrong and try correcting the boiling time on your next attempt!), turn up the flame to thicken the dal quickly. \n8. Pick out a softened green chilli from the _dal_, mash it with the back of a spoon and add it back to the dal. Add the sugar and bubble for about a minute before stirring in the _ghee_, [_Bengali garam masala_](/recipe/bengali-garam-masala), and fried coconut. Allow the _dal_ to rest, covered, for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Luchi](/recipe/luchi/)\n- [Begun bhaja](/recipe/begun-bhaja)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- [Bengali fried rice](/recipe/bengali-vegetable-fried-rice/)","source":"_posts/cholar-dal.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Chhola’r Dal\ntags:\n  - vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\n  - dal\ndescription: >-\n  The savoury-sweet cholar dal is a Bengali classic.

After this time, strain the <em>dal</em> and transfer it to a boiling pot or pressure cooker. Add 700 g water, 6 g salt, and the bay leaves. Boil the <em>dal</em> until it is tender, but the grains are still whole. The texture of this dish will depend a whole lot on how well the <em>dal</em> is boiled. We want each grain of lentil to be perfectly cooked, but not turned to mush. On medium heat, our <em>chhola’r dal</em> cooks to the desired doneness in 2 whistles. The time may vary for you.</li>\n<li>Before you begin cooking, make a spice slurry by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder and 50 g water. Also, slice the coconut and slit the green chillies. </li>\n<li>Heat mustard oil in a pan (on medium heat) and once it starts to smoke lightly and changes colour to a pale yellow, add the thinly sliced coconut. Fry until the coconut turns golden brown. This should take about a minute. Remove from the oil and set aside. </li>\n<li>Temper the same oil with the dried red chillies, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. Stir in the <em>hing</em>, allowing it to fry for about 10 seconds. </li>\n<li>Add the spice slurry we made earlier to the pan. Fry on medium heat until the raw smell of the spices is gone. This should take about 6 minutes. Add the slit green chillies and raisins, and continue frying until you see oil leaving the sides of the spice mixture. </li>\n<li>Now add the boiled <em>dal</em> along with the water to the pan. (If you feel there’s a lot of excess water with the <em>dal</em>, reserve some in a bowl.) </li>\n<li>Add the remaining salt (12 g) and allow the <em>dal</em> to bubble until it thickens (about 6 to 8 minutes). Depending on how soft or hard your <em>dal</em> is, you may have to adjust the flame and water accordingly. For example, if your <em>dal</em> is still slightly hard, boil on low heat, adding water to maintain consistency, until it is cooked. If it is on the softer, mushier side (first of all, you need to make note of where you went wrong and try correcting the boiling time on your next attempt!), turn up the flame to thicken the dal quickly. </li>\n<li>Pick out a softened green chilli from the <em>dal</em>, mash it with the back of a spoon and add it back to the dal. Add the sugar and bubble for about a minute before stirring in the <em>ghee</em>, <a href=\"/recipe/bengali-garam-masala\"><em>Bengali garam masala</em></a>, and fried coconut. Allow the <em>dal</em> to rest, covered, for 2 minutes before serving.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Served-with\"><a href=\"#Served-with\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Served with\"></a>Served with</h2><ul>\n<li><a href=\"/recipe/luchi/\">Luchi</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/recipe/begun-bhaja\">Begun bhaja</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/\">Rice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/recipe/bengali-vegetable-fried-rice/\">Bengali fried rice</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"title":"Chicken Curry","description":"A hot, spicy, and delicious Bengali chicken curry, packed full of the flavours of ginger, garlic, and shahi garam masala.","thumbnailImagePosition":"top","thumbnailImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1490315506/chicken-curry-website-thumbnail_xc4csh.jpg","coverMeta":"out","coverSize":"partial","videoId":"u6vCNSosGrc","jsonLd":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Recipe","name":"Chicken Curry or Kosha","author":"Bong Eats","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1490315506/chicken-curry-website-thumbnail_xc4csh.jpg","description":"  A hot, spicy, and delicious Bengali chicken curry, packed full of the flavours of ginger, garlic, and shahi garam masala.","prepTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT90M","recipeYield":"6 servings","recipeIngredient":["Onions (sliced) 25 g","Garlic (finely chopped) 8 g","Dried red chillies 2 pcs","Green chillies (finely chopped) 2 pcs","Ginger paste 25 g","Yoghurt 60 g","Turmeric powder 10 g","Red chilli powder 2 g","Garam masala powder 2 g","Salt 10 g","Lime juice 5 g","Mustard oil 10 g","FOR THE CURRY Chicken (cut and cleaned) 1 kg","Potatoes (halved or quartered) 200 g","Onions (thinly sliced) 300 g","Mustard oil 30 g","Dried red chillies 2 pcs","Bay leaves 2 pcs","Cardamom 3 pcs","Cloves 3 pcs","Cinnamon 1 pc","Peppercorns 8 pcs","Turmeric powder","Salt 18 g","Sugar 10 g","Coriander leaves (optional; finely chopped) 10 g","Green chillies (slit) 2 pcs","Hot water 400 g"],"recipeInstructions":["1.

In a mixing bowl large enough to hold all the chicken, combine the components of the marinade: that is, sliced onions, chopped garlic, ginger paste, chopped green chillies, yoghurt, turmeric powder (10 g), red chilli powder, [_garam masala_](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/) powder, salt (10 g), lime juice, and raw mustard oil. Don’t throw the lime peel away.\n2. Give these a good mix and then add the chicken to the bowl.\n3. Coat the chicken pieces in the marinade, making sure to get into all the nooks and crannies of the chicken. If you are also cooking the chicken liver, don’t toss it in the marinade along with the other pieces of the chicken, as it might disintegrate. Instead, add the liver after all the chicken pieces are well coated, and smear the liver with the marinade then.\n4. Stick the used lime peel in between the chicken pieces.\n5. Cover the bowl and rest the marinated chicken in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. For best results, leave it to marinate overnight.\n\n**STEP II—PREPARING THE CURRY**\n1. Peel and divide the potatoes into 4-cm halves or quarters. Put these in a microwave-safe bowl, add 2 tablespoons of water, cover the bowl with a cling film, and microwave for about 3 to 4 minutes. Alternatively, you can also parboil the potatoes in water on the stove.\n2. Cut the onions in thin slices. Thinly sliced onions (as opposed to roughly chopped or diced onions) give the curry the perfect texture.\n3. Heat 30 g mustard oil in a _kadai_. Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, temper it with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns.\n4. Add in the onions, along with the sugar, and fry them for about 8 to 10 minutes, till the onions are brown in colour. (We add the sugar at this stage to help the onions caramelize quickly.)\n5. Once the onions have caramelized, add 8 g turmeric powder and 18 g salt, along with 75 g of water.\n6. Fry the spices on medium heat till the water dries up. This should take about 5 minutes.\n7. Tip the marinated chicken into the _kadai_ (don’t forget to remove the lime peel from the bowl!), and mix it with the onions in the pan. Cook the chicken on medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will ensure that the smell of raw spices from the marinade is gone.\n8. Add in the parboiled potatoes and slit green chillies, and stir them in.\n8. Add 400 g of hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n9. Cover the pan and let the curry bubble for about 15 to 20 minutes, or till the chicken and potatoes are tender.\n10. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves.  \n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- Roti | [Luchi](/recipe/luchi/)\n","source":"_posts/chicken-curry.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Chicken Curry\ntags:\n  - chicken\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\ndescription: >-\n  A hot, spicy, and delicious Bengali chicken curry, packed full of the flavours\n  of ginger, garlic, and shahi garam masala.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1490315506/chicken-curry-website-thumbnail_xc4csh.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: u6vCNSosGrc\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Chicken Curry or Kosha\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1490315506/chicken-curry-website-thumbnail_xc4csh.jpg\",\"description\":\"  A hot, spicy, and delicious Bengali chicken curry, packed full of the flavours of ginger, garlic, and shahi garam masala.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT30M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT90M\",\"recipeYield\":\"6 servings\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"Onions (sliced) 25 g\",\"Garlic (finely chopped) 8 g\",\"Dried red chillies 2 pcs\",\"Green chillies (finely chopped) 2 pcs\",\"Ginger paste 25 g\",\"Yoghurt 60 g\",\"Turmeric powder 10 g\",\"Red chilli powder 2 g\",\"Garam masala powder 2 g\",\"Salt 10 g\",\"Lime juice 5 g\",\"Mustard oil 10 g\",\"FOR THE CURRY Chicken (cut and cleaned) 1 kg\",\"Potatoes (halved or quartered) 200 g\",\"Onions (thinly sliced) 300 g\",\"Mustard oil 30 g\",\"Dried red chillies 2 pcs\",\"Bay leaves 2 pcs\",\"Cardamom 3 pcs\",\"Cloves 3 pcs\",\"Cinnamon 1 pc\",\"Peppercorns 8 pcs\",\"Turmeric powder\",\"Salt 18 g\",\"Sugar 10 g\",\"Coriander leaves (optional; finely chopped) 10 g\",\"Green chillies (slit) 2 pcs\",\"Hot water 400 g\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

In a mixing bowl large enough to hold all the chicken, combine the components of the marinade: that is, sliced onions, chopped garlic, ginger paste, chopped green chillies, yoghurt, turmeric powder (10 g), red chilli powder, [_garam masala_](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/) powder, salt (10 g), lime juice, and raw mustard oil. Don’t throw the lime peel away.\n2. Give these a good mix and then add the chicken to the bowl.\n3. Coat the chicken pieces in the marinade, making sure to get into all the nooks and crannies of the chicken. If you are also cooking the chicken liver, don’t toss it in the marinade along with the other pieces of the chicken, as it might disintegrate. Instead, add the liver after all the chicken pieces are well coated, and smear the liver with the marinade then.\n4. Stick the used lime peel in between the chicken pieces.\n5. Cover the bowl and rest the marinated chicken in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. For best results, leave it to marinate overnight.\n\n**STEP II—PREPARING THE CURRY**\n1. Peel and divide the potatoes into 4-cm halves or quarters. Put these in a microwave-safe bowl, add 2 tablespoons of water, cover the bowl with a cling film, and microwave for about 3 to 4 minutes. Alternatively, you can also parboil the potatoes in water on the stove.\n2. Cut the onions in thin slices. Thinly sliced onions (as opposed to roughly chopped or diced onions) give the curry the perfect texture.\n3. Heat 30 g mustard oil in a _kadai_. Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, temper it with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns.\n4. Add in the onions, along with the sugar, and fry them for about 8 to 10 minutes, till the onions are brown in colour. (We add the sugar at this stage to help the onions caramelize quickly.)\n5. Once the onions have caramelized, add 8 g turmeric powder and 18 g salt, along with 75 g of water.\n6. Fry the spices on medium heat till the water dries up. This should take about 5 minutes.\n7. Tip the marinated chicken into the _kadai_ (don’t forget to remove the lime peel from the bowl!), and mix it with the onions in the pan. Cook the chicken on medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will ensure that the smell of raw spices from the marinade is gone.\n8. Add in the parboiled potatoes and slit green chillies, and stir them in.\n8. Add 400 g of hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n9. Cover the pan and let the curry bubble for about 15 to 20 minutes, or till the chicken and potatoes are tender.\n10. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves.  \n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- Roti | [Luchi](/recipe/luchi/)\n","slug":"chicken-curry","published":1,"updated":"2017-04-07T01:26:38.551Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjancyaze000ancvh64m23gxl","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">Hot and spicy, decadent and comforting</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">This versatile chicken curry can be eaten with rice for a hearty weeknight dinner, or as part of an elaborate Sunday lunch.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">T</span>his chicken curry recipe yields tender chicken pieces in a hot, flavourful, stew-like <em>jhol</em> (curry).

It is a blend of whole spices, whose proportions vary from cuisine to cuisine. The Bengali version comprises three simple spices—cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves.</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">W</span>hile the _garam masala_ used in most northern and western Indian cooking might contain everything from coriander and cumin seeds to mustard seeds, the Bengali version, in its most basic form, is made up of cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves. The preparation is simple. We dry-roast a blend of the whole spices to awaken their dormant flavours and powder them—either by hand on in an electric grinder. If stored in an airtight container, the _masala_ can keep for months.  \n\nIn Bengali cooking, _garam masala_ is used to flavour egg, chicken, mutton, lamb, or beef curries. Along with _ghee_, it is also used as garnish for several vegetarian preparations (most _ghontos_ and [_dalnas_](/tags/dalna/ \"Bengali dalna recipes\"), _khichuri_, and _panchmishali torkari_). This spice is particularly handy if you want to quickly refresh leftovers. Just add a pinch of it (along with a sliver of _ghee_) to your day-old _torkari_ while reheating, and no one need be any the wiser!\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 10 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 10 g of _garam masala_ powder\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient       |\n|----------|------------------|\n|      7 g | Cardamom (whole) |\n|      2 g | Cloves (whole)   |\n|      2 g | Cinnamon (whole) |\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | wok | frying pan\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n- Airtight container\n\n## Appliances\n- Grinder | mortar and pestle\n\n## Method\n1.

Add _atta_, salt, sugar, and oil to a mixing bowl. Mix to distribute the oil evenly among the other ingredients.\n2. Add the water. Use hot water for soft _porotas_.\n3. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes. It may seem tacky at the outset, but keep going. The dough should be soft and pliable so that it can hold a generous amount of filling.\n4. Once the kneading is done, cover and rest the dough for about 30 minutes.   \n\n**STEP II—PREPARE THE FILLING**\n1. Meanwhile, halve or quarter your potatoes (depending on their size) and steam them till they are tender. This should take about 20 minutes. Steaming ensures that the potatoes do not overcook or absorb any excess moisture from sitting in a pot of boiling water. The drier the filling, the easier it is to stuff the _porota_ without any leakage.\n2. Peel the potatoes and mash them while they are still hot to allow all the steam to escape. This will further ensure that the filling remains dry.\n3. Finely chop the onions, ginger, garlic, and green chillies. Tear or roughly chop the curry or coriander leaves, whichever you are using.\n4. Heat 7 g vegetable oil in a skillet. Add the onions and fry them for about 4 to 5 minutes till they turn brown. \n5. Add the ginger and green chillies, and fry for another minute or so before adding the garlic and curry leaves/_kasuri methi_/coriander leaves. Do not cook the garlic too much; turn off the heat 30 seconds after adding it to the pan.\n6. Transfer this mixture from the pan on to the mashed potatoes. Also add the salt, _chaat masala_, _bhaja masala_, and _jowan_.\n7. Give everything a good mix until the filling is uniform. \n\n**STEP III—STUFF, ROLL, FRY**\n1. Divide the filling into four equal parts (each should weigh about 75 g). Give the dough a quick knead and divide it into four equal portions too (about 70 g each). Form each portion of the filling and dough into a neat ball and keep at the ready.\n2. Using your hands, flatten a ball of dough until it has stretched to a diameter of 8 cm. Place a ball of the filling in the centre. \n3. Bring the sides of the dough towards one another. The idea is to completely enclose the filling with the dough. Pinch the gathered sides to seal the package.\n4. Coat the dough with some flour and place it on the workstation in front of you. Press down gently to flatten the dough and distribute the filling evenly within it.\n5. Using a rolling pin, start rolling in two short, gentle strokes. Rotate 90 degrees between each set of strokes. Keep doing this until the _porota_ is about 18 cm in diameter. Be sure to roll at the edges and not at the centre. This will ensure that the _porota_ is of a uniform thickness throughout. \n6. In a skillet set on medium heat, add 1 tbsp of oil. Once hot, lay the _porota_ flat on it. Wait for a minute and apply 1 tsp of oil to the top. Flip the _porota_.\n7. Keep flipping every minute until the _porota_ is an even, golden colour on both sides. \n8. Remove from the skillet and serve hot.\n\n\n\n## Served with\n- Yoghurt\n- Pickles\n- Green chilli\n- Raw onion","source":"_posts/aloo-paratha.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Aloo Paratha\ntags:\n  - snack\n  - vegetarian\n  - vegan\n  - paratha\ndescription: >-\n  Alu porota or ‘paratha’ needs no introduction.

In this recipe, we take you step-by-step through the process of creating soft, well-balanced _porotas_.\n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 45 minutes\n**YIELDS** 4 parathas\n**CALORIES** 385 kcal per paratha\n***\n## Ingredients\n|            Quantity | Ingredient                                     |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n|   **FOR THE DOUGH** |                                                |\n|               150 g | Atta (whole wheat flour)                       |\n|                 3 g | Salt                                           |\n|                 7 g | Sugar                                          |\n|                 8 g | Oil                                            |\n|           100–110 g | Hot water                                      |\n| **FOR THE FILLING** |                                                |\n|               250 g | Potatoes (boiled and peeled)                   |\n|                80 g | Onions (finely chopped)                        |\n|                15 g | Ginger (minced)                                |\n|                10 g | Garlic (minced)                                |\n|                 5 g | Green chillies (chopped)                       |\n|                 5 g | Kasuri methi/curry leaves/coriander leaves     |\n|                 5 g | Salt                                           |\n|               ½ tsp | Chaat masala                                   |\n|               1 tsp | Bhaja masala                                   |\n|               ¼ tsp | Jowan (carom seeds)                            |\n|               100 g | Oil for cooking/frying                         |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Steamer | boiling pot\n- Rolling pin\n- Skillet | _tawa_\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n- Napkin | paper towel (optional)\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Steamer\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—MIX THE DOUGH**\n1. Add _atta_, salt, sugar, and oil to a mixing bowl. Mix to distribute the oil evenly among the other ingredients.\n2. Add the water. Use hot water for soft _porotas_.\n3. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes. It may seem tacky at the outset, but keep going. The dough should be soft and pliable so that it can hold a generous amount of filling.\n4. Once the kneading is done, cover and rest the dough for about 30 minutes.   \n\n**STEP II—PREPARE THE FILLING**\n1. Meanwhile, halve or quarter your potatoes (depending on their size) and steam them till they are tender. This should take about 20 minutes. Steaming ensures that the potatoes do not overcook or absorb any excess moisture from sitting in a pot of boiling water. The drier the filling, the easier it is to stuff the _porota_ without any leakage.\n2. Peel the potatoes and mash them while they are still hot to allow all the steam to escape. This will further ensure that the filling remains dry.\n3. Finely chop the onions, ginger, garlic, and green chillies. Tear or roughly chop the curry or coriander leaves, whichever you are using.\n4. Heat 7 g vegetable oil in a skillet. Add the onions and fry them for about 4 to 5 minutes till they turn brown. \n5. Add the ginger and green chillies, and fry for another minute or so before adding the garlic and curry leaves/_kasuri methi_/coriander leaves. Do not cook the garlic too much; turn off the heat 30 seconds after adding it to the pan.\n6. Transfer this mixture from the pan on to the mashed potatoes. Also add the salt, _chaat masala_, _bhaja masala_, and _jowan_.\n7. Give everything a good mix until the filling is uniform. \n\n**STEP III—STUFF, ROLL, FRY**\n1. Divide the filling into four equal parts (each should weigh about 75 g). Give the dough a quick knead and divide it into four equal portions too (about 70 g each). Form each portion of the filling and dough into a neat ball and keep at the ready.\n2. Using your hands, flatten a ball of dough until it has stretched to a diameter of 8 cm. Place a ball of the filling in the centre. \n3. Bring the sides of the dough towards one another. The idea is to completely enclose the filling with the dough. Pinch the gathered sides to seal the package.\n4. Coat the dough with some flour and place it on the workstation in front of you. Press down gently to flatten the dough and distribute the filling evenly within it.\n5. Using a rolling pin, start rolling in two short, gentle strokes. Rotate 90 degrees between each set of strokes. Keep doing this until the _porota_ is about 18 cm in diameter. Be sure to roll at the edges and not at the centre. This will ensure that the _porota_ is of a uniform thickness throughout. \n6. In a skillet set on medium heat, add 1 tbsp of oil. Once hot, lay the _porota_ flat on it. Wait for a minute and apply 1 tsp of oil to the top. Flip the _porota_.\n7. Keep flipping every minute until the _porota_ is an even, golden colour on both sides. \n8. Remove from the skillet and serve hot.\n\n\n\n## Served with\n- Yoghurt\n- Pickles\n- Green chilli\n- Raw onion","slug":"aloo-paratha","published":1,"updated":"2017-09-01T02:56:10.452Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjancyazm000jncvhpsd9eurp","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A pan-fried flatbread stuffed with a filling of mashed potatoes</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">In this recipe, we take you through the process of mixing, stuffing, rolling, and frying the perfect ‘parathas’.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">A</span>lu porota or ‘alu paratha’ is wildly popular all over South Asia—no <em>dhaba</em> scene is complete without the sight of hot parathas with melting butter on top.

It's not as difficult as you imagine.</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">C</span>leaning prawns doesn’t have to be a tedious or messy task. With a bit of organisation, you can get a batch done in no time, and with minimal cleaning-up to do after. As for tools, all you need is a pair of scissors. Apart from that, keep a bin or plastic bag ready to catch the discarded shells and a bowl for the clean prawns. Put on a playlist, podcast, or audiobook of your choice. This last step is optional, but you might as well be entertained while cleaning up some crustacean.\n\nNow, coming to the anatomy of the prawn, consider the parts you want to keep, and those you want to throw away. We usually eat fleshy bits, and discard the shells and other scalier parts. For most Bengali dishes, including _chingri malai curry_ and _chingri bhaape_, we leave the head and tail of the prawn intact—the head contains all the wonderful flavour and tasty, creamy goodness, while the tail adds a nice presentation detail.\n\n***\n\n**TIME TAKEN** 20 minutes for 500 g of prawns\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient |\n|----------|------------|\n|    500 g | Prawns     |\n\n## Equipment\n- A pair of scissors\n- A dish or bag for scraps\n- A bowl or plate for clean prawns\n\n## Things to remove\n- The snout\n- The eyes\n- The walking legs\n- The shell\n- The vein\n\n## Things to keep\n- The body or the fleshy part\n- The head (for flavour and taste)\n- The tail (for presentation)\n\n## Method\n1. Use your scissors and cut off the snout, which is located on the head of the prawn, between the eyes.\n2. Next, snip off the eyes.\n3. Gather together all the walking legs (can be found under the head) and snip them off with your scissors as well.\n4. Now, hold the prawn so that its head faces you, and its dorsal side is pointed upward. Cut through the shell along the (non-existent) spine of the prawn, from the head all the way to the tail.\n5. You should now be able to peel off the shell. If it gets stuck anywhere, give it a tug and it should come loose easily.\n6. Locate the vein along the spine of the prawn.\n7. Pull the vein out and discard it.\n8. You should now have a clean prawn, minus the shells and other pointy parts.\n9. This step is optional, but we don't throw the scraps away. Place them in a pot of water and simmer for 30 minutes. Strain the liquid and you now have a shrimp stock. Freeze them in ice trays and use the stock cubes while making shrimp fried rice or _chingri malai curry_ for instant flavour-boost.  \n","source":"_posts/clean-and-devein-prawns.md","raw":"---\ntitle: How to Clean and Devein Prawns\ndescription: The best video tutorial to clean, cut and devein shrimps or prawns.

While the keeper of the Bengali kitchen might break out the precious _gobindobhog_ for _polao_, _payesh_, or _khichuri_, and the _basmati_ for _biryani_, it is the _sheddho chal_, or parboiled rice, that is piled onto plates daily. _Sheddho chal_ is named after the technique used to separate the grain from the husk. This process is said to enhance the nutritional profile of the rice and make it easier to digest.\n\nThere is something extremely satisfying in sitting down to a meal before a plate of perfectly cooked, non-sticky, pearly-white, fluffy rice. While there are innumerable ways of boiling rice and there appears to be no set formula, keeping a few things in mind is useful. (1) Washing the rice thoroughly and repeatedly helps get rid of the starch that usually contributes to its stickiness. (2) Rice, like pasta, must be boiled in a large pot of water. The water must measure at least 5 times in volume than the volume of uncooked rice. Doing so dilutes the starch and ensures that most of it gets drained out at the end, along with the water. (3) Once the rice is cooked to the desired softness, use a large strainer to remove the excess water. Letting the rice sit in the boiled, starchy water (or not draining off as much of the liquid as possible) will yield a sticky, mushy end product. (4) Sometimes, the iron content in the water tends to produce yellowish rice. For fluffy, white rice, you may add a tablespoon of vinegar or a teaspoon of _fitkari_ (alum) to the boiling pot. (5) Finally, as for boiling time, it will depend on the rice and water you use. Ours usually takes about 25 minutes. We highly recommend that you determine the cooking time for _your_ rice. Once you've done that, set a timer whenever you put a pot to boil. When the timer goes off, all you need to do is drain out the water, and you have perfectly cooked rice every single time.      \n\n***\n\n**TIME TAKEN** 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the rice and water you use\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient         |\n|----------|--------------------|\n|    1 cup | Rice               |\n|   5 cups | Water              |\n|   1 tbsp | Vinegar (optional) |\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot | saucepan\n- Lid for the boiling vessel\n- Large strainer | colander\n\n## Appliance\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1.

Cut the cabbage into the thinnest possible shreds that you can manage. To make this process easier, deal with the vegetable in sections of 5 cm each. Take a segment, one at a time, and shave off shreds along its cross-section with your knife. Take your time with the cutting, because the outcome of the dish will depend on this step. [Watch this video, which shows you how to cut cabbage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3EUuW5S7s) for _badhakopi'r ghonto_.\n\n**PART II—TEMPERING THE OIL (_PHORON_)**\n2. Heat 15 g mustard oil in a pan till it begins to smoke.\n3. Add the _phoron_ (comprising the dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and cumin seeds) to the oil.\n4. Once the spices start crackling, add in the cubed potatoes.\n5. Fry the potatoes for 3 minutes on low heat, with the lid on.\n\n**PART III—SAUTEEING THE SPICES**\n6. Make a paste by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and 80 g of water.\n7. Add this mixture to the potatoes and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n8. Add in the diced tomatoes and shelled peas.\n9. Then, add another 80 g of water and sautee the spices till the water dries off.\n10. Add a slit green chilli and cook with the lid on for another minute.\n\n**PART IV—STEAMING THE CABBAGE**\n11. Add the shredded cabbage to the pan, along with the salt.\n12. Fold in the spices and cook on low heat with the lid on. The salt will start dehydrating the cabbage and drawing out its moisture.\n13. Steam the cabbage on low heat, with the lid on, for 12 minutes, stirring intermittently. Keep an eye on the pan to ensure that the cabbage doesn’t stick to the bottom.\n14. Add the sugar and cook for another 15 minutes, stirring intermittently. The sugar will soon start to caramelise. Be sure to scrape down and integrate the lightly browned bits of the _torkari_ that stick to the bottom of your pan (they are yummy!).\n15. This step is optional. You can coat a couple of cleaned prawns in a pinch of salt and turmeric powder, and fry in a separate pan for 30 seconds on each side. Chop the fried prawns in chunks of 1 cm, and add to the _ghonto_.\n16. Garnish with _ghee_, powdered _garam masala_, and a  slit green chilli.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | roti\n","source":"_posts/badhakopir-ghonto.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Badhakopi’r Ghonto | Dry Cabbage and Peas Curry\ndescription: A mildly spiced dry cabbage curry with peas-a kind of Bengali vegetarian ghonto with delicate flavours of ginger, garam masala and ghee.\ntags:\n  - ghonto\n  - torkari\n  - vegetarian\n  - vegan\n  - gluten-free\n  - cabbage\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1479339208/badhakopir-ghonto_thumbnail_c7ocub.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: nmkY-fGFTuY\ndate: 2016-12-01 20:30:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Badhakopi'r ghonto\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1479339208/badhakopir-ghonto_cover-small_uif59l.jpg\",\"description\":\"This is a beautifully spiced cabbage and peas preparation that is hot, sweet, and with hints of ginger, ghee, and garam masala.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT10M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT45M\",\"recipeYield\":\"4\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"Mustard oil (for cooking) 15 g\",\"Dried red chillies 1 piece\",\"Bay leaves 1 piece\",\"Cardamom 1 piece\",\"Cloves 1 piece\",\"Cinnamon 1 piece\",\"Cumin seeds 2 g (or ¼ tsp)\",\"Cabbage 400 g\",\"Potatoes 100 g\",\"Peas 50 g\",\"Tomatoes 30 g\",\"Prawns (optional) 75 g\",\"Ginger paste 20 g\",\"Cumin powder 2 g\",\"Coriander powder 1 g\",\"Turmeric powder 3 g\",\"Red chilli powder 1 g\",\"Salt 10 g\",\"Sugar 25 g\",\"Ghee 4 g\",\"Garam masala ¼ tsp\",\"Green chillies 2 g (or 2 pieces)\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1 Cut the cabbage into the thinnest possible shreds that you can manage.

[Watch this video, which shows you how to cut cabbage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3EUuW5S7s) for _badhakopi'r ghonto_.\n\n**PART II—TEMPERING THE OIL (_PHORON_)**\n2. Heat 15 g mustard oil in a pan till it begins to smoke.\n3. Add the _phoron_ (comprising the dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and cumin seeds) to the oil.\n4. Once the spices start crackling, add in the cubed potatoes.\n5. Fry the potatoes for 3 minutes on low heat, with the lid on.\n\n**PART III—SAUTEEING THE SPICES**\n6. Make a paste by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and 80 g of water.\n7. Add this mixture to the potatoes and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n8. Add in the diced tomatoes and shelled peas.\n9. Then, add another 80 g of water and sautee the spices till the water dries off.\n10. Add a slit green chilli and cook with the lid on for another minute.\n\n**PART IV—STEAMING THE CABBAGE**\n11. Add the shredded cabbage to the pan, along with the salt.\n12. Fold in the spices and cook on low heat with the lid on. The salt will start dehydrating the cabbage and drawing out its moisture.\n13. Steam the cabbage on low heat, with the lid on, for 12 minutes, stirring intermittently. Keep an eye on the pan to ensure that the cabbage doesn’t stick to the bottom.\n14. Add the sugar and cook for another 15 minutes, stirring intermittently. The sugar will soon start to caramelise. Be sure to scrape down and integrate the lightly browned bits of the _torkari_ that stick to the bottom of your pan (they are yummy!).\n15. This step is optional. You can coat a couple of cleaned prawns in a pinch of salt and turmeric powder, and fry in a separate pan for 30 seconds on each side. Chop the fried prawns in chunks of 1 cm, and add to the _ghonto_.\n16. Garnish with _ghee_, powdered _garam masala_, and a  slit green chilli.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | roti\n","slug":"badhakopir-ghonto","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-30T02:30:24.573Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjancyb020011ncvhlgzixfu9","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A dry curry of cabbage</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">This is a beautifully spiced cabbage-and-peas preparation that is a little hot, a little sweet, and with hints of ginger, <em>ghee</em>, and <em>garam masala</em>.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">B</span><em>adhakopi’r ghonto</em> is essentially prepared by steaming fine shreds of cabbage (about 2 mm wide) in their own moisture, which is drawn out with the help of salt.

Rinse and soak the dal in water overnight (at least 12 hours). Drain it from the water and transfer it to a saucepan.\n2. Add 800 g water, 10 g salt, and 20 g onions to the the saucepan. Cover and boil the dal on low heat. The dal should be soft but remain unbroken. So be sure to keep an eye on it so that it doesn’t disintegrate. Once done, strain the dal and reserve the water for later. \n3. Cut potatoes into 1.5-cm cubes, onions and coconut into thin slices, and roughly chop the tomato. Also crush the garlic and green chillies into a paste using a mortar and pestle.\n4. Set a pan on medium heat and add 15 g mustard oil with 5 g ghee. Once hot, add the coconut slices and fry them until they are golden-brown. Remove them from the oil and set aside. Temper the oil with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. \n5. Once the whole spices are crackling, add the onions and fry them until brown. This should take about 6 minutes. Next add the potatoes and fry for 3 minutes before adding the tomatoes. Cook the tomatoes until they are soft (about 2 minutes).\n6. Add the garlic-and-green-chilli paste, and ginger paste. Fry these for about 3 minutes. During this time, make a paste of turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, kashmiri red chilli powder, and 100 g water. Add it to the pan.\n7. Fry until the smell of raw spices is gone. This should take about 8 to 10 minutes. If the spices dry out, add a splash of the dal water that we reserved earlier and continue frying.\n8. Once the spices have started releasing their oils, add the boiled _motor_ dal to the pan. Fold it with the spices and cook for 2 minutes before add the reserved water. \n9. Add the remaining salt and sugar and turn up the heat. Bubble on high flame for about 6 minutes until the curry loses its watery consistency. Stir in two slit green chillies and the fried coconut. Cover and rest for 2 minutes.\n10. Before serving, garnish with [_Bhaja masala_](https://youtu.be/gGmCPwauVBs), chopped onions, chopped green chillies and tamarind pulp. Serve piping hot.  \n\n\n## Served with\n- White quarter pound bread loaves toasted over an open flame\n- Luchi","slug":"ghugni","published":1,"updated":"2017-10-06T06:36:56.815Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjancyb050014ncvho63v1b8a","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">Spicy, curried snack made with yellow peas</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Ghugni is an iconic vegetarian Bengali snack made with dried yellow peas and served with luchi or pauruti</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">G</span>hugni is one of the most beloved of Bengali snacks.

This is a hearty, filling curry, best served with a plate of steaming rice.\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 40 minutes   \n**YIELDS** a serving of 4 eggs\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Sl|                Quantity | Ingredient                                  |\n|---|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|   |**OIL**                  |                                             |\n| 1 |                    20 g | Mustard oil (for frying)                    |\n| 2 |                    20 g | Mustard oil (for cooking)                   |\n|   |**_PHORON_ (TEMPERING)** |                                             |\n| 3 |                2 pieces | Dried red chillies (whole)                  |\n| 4 |                 1 piece | Bay leaves (whole)                          |\n| 5 |                2 pieces | Cardamom (whole)                            |\n| 6 |                2 pieces | Cloves (whole)                              |\n| 7 |                 1 piece | Cinnamon (whole)                            |\n| 8 |          1 g (or ¼ tsp) | Cumin seeds                                 |\n|   |**EGGS AND VEGETABLES**  |                                             |\n| 9 |                4 pieces | Duck or chicken eggs (boiled)               |\n|10 |                4 pieces | Potatoes (diced; 5 cm cubes)                |\n|11 |                   100 g | Onions (thinly sliced)                      |\n|12 |                    25 g | Tomatoes (diced)                            |\n|13 |                    15 g | Ginger paste                                |\n|14 |                     2 g | Garlic paste                                |\n|   |**SPICES AND SEASONING** |                                             |\n|15 |                     2 g | Cumin powder                                |\n|16 |                     2 g | Coriander powder                            |\n|17 |                     4 g | Turmeric powder (for the curry)             |\n|18 |                   ¼ tsp | Turmeric powder (for coating the eggs with) |\n|19 |                     1 g | Red chilli powder                           |\n|20 |                     6 g | Salt (for the curry)                        |\n|21 |                    6 g  | Salt (for boiling potatoes)                 |\n|22 |                   ¼ tsp | Salt (for coating the eggs with)            |\n|23 |                    15 g | Sugar                                       |\n|24 |                 1 piece | Green chilli (slit)                         |\n\n## Equipment\n- Saucepan | boiling pot\n- _Kadai_ | wok | frying pan | cooking pot\n- Lid for cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n- Microwavable bowl (optional)\n- Plastic wrap (optional)\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Microwave (optional)\n- Electric kettle (optional)\n\n## Method\n**PART I—BOILING AND FRYING THE EGGS**\n1. Bring a pot of water to a boil.\n2. Lower the eggs (which should be at room temperature; eggs from the refrigerator might crack when added to boiling water) in the water and cook them on low heat for 6 minutes (duck eggs) or 5 minutes (chicken eggs), with the lid on.\n3. Turn off the heat and let the eggs sit in the hot water for another 3 minutes. We want the yolks gooey.\n4. Drain the water and remove the shells.\n5. Prick the eggs all around with a toothpick. This will prevent the eggs from bursting when fried and also allow the gravy to seep to the yolk.\n6. Coat the eggs in ¼ tsp each of salt and turmeric powder.\n7. Fry the eggs in 10 g mustard oil on medium heat for 5 minutes, till they develop an even amber-coloured crust.\n8. Set aside.\n\n  **PART II—BOILING THE POTATOES**\n1. Peel and cut the potatoes in chunks of 5 cm. We need as many pieces of potatoes as there are eggs (four, in this case).\n2. Place them in a microwaveable bowl with 6 g of salt and 2 tablespoons of water.\n3. Cover with cling film and microwave for 3 minutes. Alternatively, you can also boil them on the stove till partially cooked.\n4. Set aside.\n\n  **PART III—PREPARING THE CURRY**\n1. Now, heat 20 g mustard oil in a pan.\n2. Temper the oil with the _phoron_ (dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds).\n3. Once the whole spices start to crackle in oil, add the chopped onions and sugar to the pan and fry on medium heat for 5–7 minutes.\n4. Add the ginger paste and minced garlic to the pan, and fry for another 3–4 minutes.\n5. Make a spice paste by adding 50 g water to the cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and salt.\n6. Add this mixture to the pan and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n7. Then, add another 50g of water, along with the tomatoes and green chilli, and cook till the water dries off again.\n8. Add the parboiled potatoes and cook on low heat for 2 minutes.\n9. Then add the eggs. Cook for another minute. Stop here if you want _dim’er kosha_, a rich gravy to accompany your fried rice or _luchi_. For a lighter curry to eat with steamed rice, proceed to the next step.\n10. Now, add 225 g hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n11. Boil for 5–7 minutes with the lid on before removing from the heat.\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Steamed rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- Fried rice\n- Luchi\n","source":"_posts/dimer-dalna.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Dim’er Dalna or Duck Egg Curry\ndescription: The ultimate Bengali egg curry made with duck eggs-boiled, fried golden, then cooked in onion-garlic-ginger-tomato-garam masala sauce.\ntags:\n  - dalna\n  - curry\n  - egg\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1488865263/dimer-dalna-website_xexmyd.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: bMuoNOjW4Wc\ndate: 2016-07-28 21:39:47\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Dim'er dalna\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1488865263/dimer-dalna-website_xexmyd.jpg\",\"description\":\"This is a hearty, filling curry.

Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city. Make these at home, or hunt them down from the source—irrespective of how you get your hands on these items, we hope you enjoy them.</em>]</p>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">E</span>ma datshi is the national dish of Bhutan, and rightly so. All across the country, residents and travellers alike can be seen eating this hearty concoction of cheese and chillies. Apart from Bhutan, this preparation is also consumed in several parts of Northeast India and Nepal. ‘Ema’ and ‘datshi’ literally stand for ‘chillies’ and ‘cheese’, and as such can be made using one or more varieties of either ingredient. ‘Datshi’ is also used to refer to any cheese-based soup (the version with potatoes, for example, is called ‘kewa datshi’ where ‘kewa’ means potatoes). </p>\n<p>This dish can be prepared using an assortment of chilli peppers for flavour. We’ve used jalapeños, but look for slightly large chillies such as those commonly used for <em>achar</em> or pickles. We’ve combined them with green chillies, which provide the heat. As for cheese, any good, locally available melting cheese (such as that commonly found in New Market in Calcutta) will do. In a pinch, you can also use processed cheese. Avoid using a stringy cheese like mozzarella for this soup. </p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 25 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 2 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>220 g</td>\n<td>Jalapeños (quartered)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 g</td>\n<td>Green chillies (slit)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>70 g</td>\n<td>Onions (sliced)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Garlic (roughly chopped)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50 g</td>\n<td>Tomatoes (diced)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>75 g</td>\n<td>Cheese (grated)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Butter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7 g</td>\n<td>Vegetable oil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>250 g</td>\n<td>Water</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Saucepan | <em>kadai</em> with lid</li>\n<li>Cheese grater</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Remove the stalks off the chilli peppers and cut them in quarters lengthwise.

He travelled all over the world, imbibing the best aspects of every culture he encountered. He loved collecting menu cards and recipes from dinners and lunches on his travels. He would bring them back to his wife, Mrinalini, and request that the recipes be incorporated into the repertoire of the Tagore kitchen. According to accounts, some of his experiments with food were downright whimsical (pureed-garlic fritters, anyone?)</p>\n<p>Indira Devi Chaudhurani (daughter of Satyendranath Tagore) was one of Rabindranath’s favourite nieces.

Using a slicer, cut the potatoes into 2-mm-thick slices. Alternatively, you can also use a sharp knife cut thin slices by hand. Reserve the slices in a large bowl of water to prevent the potatoes from oxidizing.\n2. Wash the potato slices in plenty of water to remove the starch. Doing so will allow the _alu bhaja_ to crisp up nicely. Change the water 2–3 times during this process to make sure that most of the starch is gone. Drain the water when done.\n3. Now, lay out absorbent towels on a surface and spread out the washed potato slices in a single layer. We want the potatoes to be completely dry before we move on to the next stage—moisture will make the fries limp. Take your time. Dab them with another towel, or let them air dry for long as it takes for them to be completely dry.\n4. Bunch together 5–6 slices at a time, and chop them into matchsticks, 2-mm-wide.\n5. Heat about 500 g vegetable oil in a pan. The secret to non-greasy fries is to use a lot of oil. The excessive amount of oil will allow the potato juliennes to float freely, rather than lump together and trap steam. The temperature of the oil is also important for this recipe. It should be adequately hot (at around 180°C), but should never reach the smoking point.\n6. Once the oil is hot, fry the peanuts for 20 seconds, drain, and reserve for later. Do the same with the curry leaves, frying them for 10 seconds.\n7. Now, drop a small handful of potatoes into the oil. It is important not to overcrowd the pan. When the potatoes hit the oil, they will release a lot of steam. With time, the bubbles will gradually start subsiding (in about 3 minutes or so). The process of frying essentially serves to dehydrate the potatoes—and _that_ is what lets them turn crisp, and stay crisp, longer. When the moisture has evaporated as steam bubbles, you know that the _alu bhaja_ is crunchy. Fry for another 2 minutes for it to develop colour.\n7. Strain the _alu bhaja_ from the oil, and transfer to a perforated vessel (such as a colander or wicker basket) to cool. A basket allows the remaining steam to get out. Otherwise the steam will condense into water as the fries cool, making them limp.\n8. Garnish with the fried peanuts and curry leaves.\n9. FOR THE SEASONING, mix together the freshly ground pepper, salt, rock salt, chaat masala, and red chilli powder in the given proportions. Sprinkle this mix on the _alu bhaja_ just before eating.

The rice used is _gobindobhog chaal_, a scented, short-grained variety with which _polao_ and _payesh_ are also typically made. \n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 1 hour 15 minutes\n**YIELDS** 6-8 servings\n**CALORIES** 413 kcal per serving\n***\n## Ingredients\n|   Quantity | Ingredient                 |\n|------------|----------------------------|\n|      200 g | Moong dal                  |\n|      200 g | Gobindobhog rice           |\n|      200 g | Potatoes (5 cm chunks)     |\n|      200 g | Cauliflower (5 cm florets) |\n|      100 g | Tomatoes (quartered)       |\n|       80 g | Peas (blanched)            |\n|        2 g | Cumin seeds                |\n|      3 pcs | Cardamom (whole)           |\n|       1 pc | Cinnamon (whole)           |\n|      3 pcs | Cloves (whole)             |\n|      3 pcs | Dried red chillies         |\n|      4 pcs | Bay leaves                 |\n|       40 g | Ginger paste               |\n|       40 g | Grated coconut             |\n|        5 g | Turmeric powder            |\n|        5 g | Cumin powder               |\n|       25 g | Salt                       |\n|       50 g | Sugar                      |\n|      5 pcs | Green chillies (slit)      |\n|       10 g | Ghee                       |\n|      ½ tsp | Garam masala powder        |\n|       20 g | Vegetable oil              |\n|       15 g | Mustard oil                |\n| 1.8 litres | Hot water                  |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Large _kadai_ | frying pan | boiling pot\n- Lid for the cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n- Colander or draining nets\n- Electric kettle | saucepan (to heat water)\n\n## Appliances\n- Grinder | grater (to grate coconut)\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1. Rinse _gobindobhog_ rice thoroughly, spread it it over a colander or net, and leave it to air-dry completely.\n2. Cut potatoes in 5-cm chunks, cauliflower into 5-cm florets, and tomatoes into quarters. Shell and blanch the peas.\n3. Set a _kadai_ on medium heat and add the _moong dal_ to it. Dry-roast the _dal_ for about 6 minutes or till it turns pinkish-brown giving off a nutty aroma. Stir continuously throughout to get an even roast.\n4. Once roasted, transfer the _dal_ to a large bowl or saucepan, and wash it. Rinse just once; overrinsing will cause the _moong dal_ to lose its nutty scent. Strain over a colander and set aside.\n5. Back in the _kadai_, heat 5 g vegetable oil. Add the washed _gobindobhog_ rice to it.\n6. Fry the rice for about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently, till it takes on a glassy look. Frying activates the sweet smell of _gobindobhog_ rice. Once done, transfer the rice to a plate; set aside.\n7. In the same _kadai_, add 15 g more vegetable oil. Fry the potatoes till they develop a golden film. Remove from oil and set aside. Add the cauliflower to the pan, fry till the florets are lightly coloured, and set those aside too.\n8. In a small bowl, mix the ginger paste, turmeric powder, and cumin powder with 50 g water. Keep it ready. Also set water to boil on the stove or in an electric kettle.\n9. Now, add 15 g mustard oil to the pan, set on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, temper it with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. \n10. Add the grated coconut. Fry for about 3 minutes until the coconut turns golden.\n11. Add the ginger-turmeric-cumin paste to the pan. Fry the spices on medium heat till the their raw smell is gone and oil starts oozing from the mixture. This should take about 8 minutes. If you find during this time that the mixture has run dry, add about 50 g more water and continue frying.\n12. Add the tomatoes, cover, and cook for about 2 minutes. \n13. Next, add the fried _gobindobhog_ rice, roasted _moond dal_, and 2 slit green chillies. Stir them into the spices and cook for about 2 minutes.\n14. Add 1.8 litres of hot water along with the salt. Cover the pan and allow its contents to boil for about 5 minutes. The heat should be set at low from this point onwards.\n15. Once the water is bubbling, add the fried potatoes and cauliflower. Cover and cook for about 15 minutes. _Dal_ tends to settle at the bottom and stick to the pan, so don’t forget to stir occasionally, scraping the bottom thoroughly. \n16. After 15 minutes, add the sugar, blanched peas, and 3 more slit green chillies. Stir everything in and cook for 3 to 4 more minutes.\n17. Garnish with ghee and garam masala powder. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and allow the _khichuri_ to rest for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Panchmishali torkari](/recipe/panchmishali-torkari/)\n- Papad\n- Omelette\n- [Begun bhaja](/recipe/begun-bhaja/)\n","slug":"khichuri","published":1,"updated":"2017-07-07T02:21:59.428Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjancyb0k001nncvh7pa5m575","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">The Bengali variant of ‘khichdi’ made with roasted moong dal and fragrant <em>gobindobhog</em> rice</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\"><em>Khichuri</em> is one of those rare dishes that effortlessly strides the boundary between what’s considered ‘ordinary’ and ‘special’ when it comes to cooking.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">I</span>f there is one common thread linking the varied and multitudinous South Asian cuisines, it is <em>khichuri</em>.

Because it is sparsely spiced, this style of curry doesn’t overpower the star ingredient—the fish—but lets it shine on its own. This recipe for _ilish machh’er tel jhol_ uses only seven ingredients, including the fish. Needless to say, it is designed to bring out the flavours of the fresh _ilish_ in all their glory. If you have under 30 minutes and a batch of fresh _ilish_, this should be your go-to curry\n***\nIlish or hilsa is, however, is facing extinction due to high demand and overfishing. While [policy initiatives](http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/iucn_hilsa_study.pdf) between India and Bangladesh [are underway](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/india-bangladesh-seek-to-save-the-delectable-hilsa-113062700390_1.html) to tackle this alarming situation (hilsa conservation depends a great deal on water flow in the Padma-Meghna and Hooghly-Bhagirathi river systems), we can do our bit too. We can be mindful _not to buy any hilsa_ that is under 500 g / 25 cm. Catching of hilsa before the spawning stage is detrimental to the progression of the next generation. It is equally important also to _not buy hilsa during the breeding season_ (especially October to November, but even better, until March). In 2016, Bangaldesh was able to [increase its hilsa yield](https://scroll.in/article/806667/how-king-hilsa-made-a-comeback) by 50 per cent by putting measures in place to ban fishing in the breeding season. It also laid down and imposed specifications for net size to prevent the catching of juvenile hilsa.

Marinate the fish with ¾ tsp salt and ¾ tsp turmeric powder, and set aside.\n2. Cut the brinjal into 5-cm chunks and slit the green chillies.\n3. Before you begin, also make a paste of 18 g salt, 6 g turmeric, and 50 g water. \n4. Heat 35 g mustard oil in a pan till it starts to smoke lightly and changes colour to a pale yellow. Add the brinjal and fry them till they are golden. On medium heat, this should take about 4 minutes. Drain from the oil and set aside.\n5. Now, lower the fish pieces into the oil one by one and fry them for a minute on each side. Delicately flavoured fish such as the _ilish_ does not need heavy searing, so fry very lightly. Remove from the oil and set aside.\n6. Temper the same oil with _kaalo jeere_ and 3 green chillies. Add the salt and turmeric mixture we prepared earlier. Fry until the smell of raw turmeric is gone. This should take about 6 to 7 minutes.\n7. Add 350 g hot water. This will form the curry. Once it has come to a full boil, add the fried brinjal and allow it to bubble in the curry for about 2 minutes. Then, gently lower the fried fish. Be careful while stirring at this point because the fish is fragile and might break. \n8. Boil on medium heat for about 5 minutes, after which take 2 tablespoons of the curry into a small bowl along with a couple of the softened green chillies. Add ¼ tsp of _atta_ to this and mix everything until uniform. Mash the green chillies to release heat and flavour. Add this mixture back to the pan.

Also known as the climbing perch fish because of its ability _climb_ out of water and walk on land for short distances, _koi machh_ is _always_ bought live at fish markets. It has an extremely slippery exterior, making the use of ash rather necessary while handling the fish for cleaning. Even if the _koi machh_ is scaled, degilled, and cleaned by your fish-seller, it might still be quite slimy to the touch. At home, you may need to rub the fish against an abrasive surface to get rid of the slipperiness (a perforated, steel colander-plate does this job quite well).\n\nComing to this recipe, its main ingredients, _koi machh_ and _phulkopi_ (cauliflower), are fried separately to enhance their flavours, and then added to the delicious _jhol_. The _jhol_ itself is a hot, gingery, _garam-masala_-infused curry that is mildly sweet, but never too spicy. It uplifts the taste of anything it gets soaked up in—potatoes, cauliflower, _bori_, or the fish. Eaten with a generous helping of steaming hot rice, this dish, the _phulkopi diye koi machh’er jhol_ is the Bengali’s favourite fish curry for the winter months.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 40 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|                         Quantity | Ingredient                        |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                             30 g | Mustard oil (for frying)          |\n|                             10 g | Mustard oil (for cooking)         |\n|              350 g (or 5 pieces) | Koi machh (climbing perch fish)   |\n|              150 g (or 5 pieces) | Cauliflower (5-cm florets)        |\n|              100 g (or 5 pieces) | Potatoes (cut lengthwise)         |\n|                        10 pieces | Dal’er bori                       |\n|                             20 g | Tomato (3-cm quarters)                |\n|                            ¼ tsp | Cumin seeds (whole)               |\n|                            2 pcs | Cardamom (whole)                  |\n|                          1 piece | Cinnamon (whole)                  |\n|                          1 piece | Bay leaf                          |\n|                         4 pieces | Green chillies (slit)             |\n|                              7 g | Ginger paste                      |\n|                             15 g | Cumin powder                      |\n|  4 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating) | Turmeric powder                   |\n|                              1 g | Red chilli powder                 |\n| 18 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating) | Salt                              |\n|                             15 g | Sugar                             |\n|                            350 g | Water (hot)                       |\n|                              6 g | Coriander leaves (finely chopped) |\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- Lid for the cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE INGREDIENTS**\n1. Smear the _koi machh_ with ¾ tsp each of salt and turmeric till they are evenly coated. Set them aside.\n2. Cut a cauliflower into chunky florets, about 5 cm large. Take as many florets as there are pieces of fish (in this case, five).\n3. Peel and cut the potatoes lengthwise. Again, we need as many pieces of potatoes as there are fish.\n4. Chop the tomato into 3-cm quarters.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE _BORI_, CAULIFLOWER, AND FISH**\n1. Heat a _kadai_ till it is completely hot. Drizzle 30 g mustard oil into the pan till it starts smoking lightly, and changes colour from deep to pale yellow.\n2. Add all the _dal’er bori_ into the oil and fry them till they are golden. This should take about 15–20 seconds. The bori tend to brown quickly, so stay on the watch.\n3. Remove the fried _bori_ from the pan and set aside.\n4. Now, add the cauliflower florets, along with ¼ tsp of salt, to the pan and fry them till they develop a light-brown colour. This should take about 4 minutes in all.\n5. Remove the cauliflower from the pan and set aside.\n6. Finally, add the marinated _koi machh_ to the same oil, one at a time, and fry them for no longer than a minute on each side. This is a freshwater fish with delicate flavours. So be sure not to sear the fish too long.\n7. Remove the fish from the pan and set aside.\n8. You now have fried _bori_, fried cauliflower, and fried fish ready for use at a later stage, and can now move on to the preparation of the curry.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING THE _JHOL_**\n1. At this point, inspect the oil in your pan. If it looks too burnt, replace it with 10 g of fresh mustard oil. If it is alright, use the same oil to cook the curry in as it contains all the flavour from the fried fish.\n2. Temper the oil, set on medium heat, with the bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin seeds, and 2 slit green chillies.\n3. Add the potatoes to the pan and fry them, with the lid on, for 4 minutes.\n4. While the potatoes are frying, make a paste by combining cumin powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, salt, sugar, and 50 g water.\n5. Add this mixture into the pan and fry it, with lid on, till the water dries up.\n6. Now, add in the ginger paste and the tomatoes, and incorporate them with the spices. Introduce another 50 g water to the pan and sauté the spices again till the water dries off.\n7. The key here is to cover and cook because, alongside sautéing the spices, we also want to allow time for the potatoes to become tender.\n8. Add in the fried cauliflower florets, fold them into the spices, and cook them for a minute or so.\n9. Now, add 350 g of hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n10. Once it comes to a boil, add in the fried _bori_, fried fish, and two (more) of the slit green chillies.\n11. Using a spoon, gently try and submerge the fish in the curry. Be delicate as the fish is quite fragile at this stage.\n12. Cover the pan and allow the curry to simmer for about 6 minutes.\n13. Chop fresh coriander and add it to the pan.

Also known as the climbing perch fish because of its ability <em>climb</em> out of water and walk on land for short distances, <em>koi machh</em> is <em>always</em> bought live at fish markets. It has an extremely slippery exterior, making the use of ash rather necessary while handling the fish for cleaning. Even if the <em>koi machh</em> is scaled, degilled, and cleaned by your fish-seller, it might still be quite slimy to the touch. At home, you may need to rub the fish against an abrasive surface to get rid of the slipperiness (a perforated, steel colander-plate does this job quite well).</p>\n<p>Coming to this recipe, its main ingredients, <em>koi machh</em> and <em>phulkopi</em> (cauliflower), are fried separately to enhance their flavours, and then added to the delicious <em>jhol</em>. The <em>jhol</em> itself is a hot, gingery, <em>garam-masala</em>-infused curry that is mildly sweet, but never too spicy. It uplifts the taste of anything it gets soaked up in—potatoes, cauliflower, <em>bori</em>, or the fish.

This recipe, <em>kumro’r jhal</em>, is defined by the heat and aroma that comes from freshly crushed green chillies and <em>kaalo jeere</em>. In a way, the green chilli and <em>kaalo jeere</em> combination is a timeless one when it comes to Bengali cooking—these two work hand-in-hand to temper several classic dishes. In this recipe, these are not only used as <em>phoron</em> but they are also pasted and added to the curry itself. Apart from that, this unusual <em>jhal</em> recipe also makes use of coconut paste, some milk, and a pinch of flour, all of which render a light, yet creamy, gravy. This dish is extremely easy to make (it doesn’t require you to spend several minutes sauteing spices) and can be knocked out in under 30 minutes.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong>  25 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 4 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>500 g</td>\n<td>Kumro (ripe or green pumpkin or butternut squash)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>200 g</td>\n<td>Water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n<td>Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 pcs</td>\n<td>Green chillies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pc</td>\n<td>Bay leaf</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 pcs</td>\n<td>Dried red chillies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16 g</td>\n<td>Pasted coconut</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>40 g</td>\n<td>Milk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Maida (flour)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Saucepan or boiling pot with lid</li>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan</li>\n<li><em>Khunti</em> | long spatula</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Grinder | <em>sheel-nora</em> (to paste coconut)</li>\n<li>Mortar and pestle (to crush green chillies and <em>kaalo jeere</em>)</li>\n<li>Stove</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Peel the pumpkin and cut it into 4-cm-large cubes.</li>\n<li>Transfer the cubes to a saucepan.

But what makes a good roll? It should be served hot. So the assembly process, once the <em>paratha</em> has been fried,  needs to be quick and efficient. The outer shell, the <em>paratha</em> itself, must be flaky yet soft. It should not be too chewy, that is to say, you should not have to tug at it with your teeth. Most importantly, the <em>paratha</em> should be fully cooked and crisp. The filling should be evenly distributed so you get a little of everything with each bite. Finally, the mark of an excellently wrapped roll is that you can eat it using just one hand. Simply bite into your roll and when you reach the paper, gently grip the roll with your teeth to slide it out as you go along. No overflowing filling, no leaking sauces.

It makes use of vegetable parts that would otherwise have been thrown away—the <em>lau’er khosha</em> or peels of bottle gourd. Bengal has been unfortunate to witness a number of travesties throughout its history—two very major famines, the Partition, and a number of instances of large-scale migration. Even though the region has been blessed with agricultural abundance, these events, especially the famines, forced cooks to think of alternative means of sustenance. They turned to scraps, not-so-fresh vegetable rejects at the <em>bazaar</em>, and tough, fibrous parts of plants that no one thought to eat previously. The shrewd skills of the cooks, the women of the household, were called upon to make these throwaway items delectable. Several such recipes have survived to the modern day.

This dish benefits from a low-and-slow cooking method, which really helps draw out all the flavours of the _lau_. The vegetable is to be cut into about 3-mm-wide matchsticks. Larger pieces will not only fail to yield curry of the desired texture, but will also prevent the seasoning and spices from entering the _lau_. Throughout the cooking process, keep the heat low and the pan covered. Stir occasionally to ensure that the _lau_ doesn’t stick to the pan. In this version of the _lau’er ghonto_, besides the usual suspects (ginger, cumin powder, [_garam masala_](/recipe/bengali-garam-masala/), etc.), we have also added some roasted _moong dal_ and fried _dal’er bori_. Both of these lend the preparation an amazing nutty undertone, along with a subtle bit of crunch.

Set aside.\n3. In a pan set on medium flame, add the _moong dal_.\n4. Dry-roast the _dal_, stirring continuously, till it changes colour to a pinkish-brown. This should take about 4 minutes.\n5. Once the _dal_ is roasted, remove it from the pan, and set aside for later.\n5. To the same pan set on medium heat, add 15 g mustard oil.\n6. Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, add in the _dal’er bori_.\n7. Fry the _boris_ till they turn golden. Drain from the oil and set aside for later.\n8. Temper the same oil with the dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and cumin seeds.\n9. Once the whole spices have started crackling, add the ginger-turmeric-cumin paste that we prepared earlier.\n10. Fry the spices till they release oil (about 4 minutes). You may add an additional 25 g water to the pan if the spices turn dry and start to stick to the bottom of the pan.\n11. Once the spices have fried, add in the roasted _moong dal_ and cook everything for 2 minutes.\n12. Then add all the shredded _lau_, along with the salt. Mix till the vegetable is coated with the spices.\n13. Cover the pan and let the _lau_ steam for a good 20 minutes. During this time, the salt will help draw the moisture from the gourd and soften it. Don’t forget to stir occasionally to ensure that the _lau_ doesn’t stick to the pan.\n14. Once the gourd is soft, add the sugar and slit green chillies. Cover and cook for another 8 minutes.\n15. Break the fried _bori_ into shards and add them to the pan, along with freshly chopped coriander leaves.

A good paneer must be well formed and not crumbly. Its structure shouldn’t be too tight, otherwise it will become tough and not absorb any curry. \n\nWhile paneer is especially adored among aficionados of some branches of north Indian cuisine in particular—it is the vegetarian’s delight—its close cousin _chhana_ (or _chhena_) holds a special place in Bengali cooking. From being the base for all manner of Bengali sweets (_sondesh_, _roshogolla_, anyone?), it is also used to make _chhana’r torkari_, a curry with mildly spiced _chhana koftas_, which is a beloved delicacy.\n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 30 minutes\n**YIELDS** 300 g paneer (6 people)\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                  | \n|----------|-----------------------------|\n|   1.5 kg | Whole milk                  |\n|     30 g | White vinegar or lime juice |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot\n- Wooden spoon\n- Large bowl\n- Strainer\n- Muslin | cheesecloth\n- Sharp knife\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1.

Hang it over your sink and allow the remaining water in the paneer to drip naturally (for about 30 minutes). Do not squeeze or put any weight on it.

Soak the poppy seeds in hot water for at least two hours. After that, grind them to a fine paste. When you rub some of the paste between your fingers, it should feel smooth, that is, the individual poppy seeds should not be discernable. The finer you grind the poppy seeds, the better the flavour.","2. Peel the lau and cut it into 3-mm-thick matchsticks.","3. Set a pan on medium heat and add in the lau along with half of the salt (about 10 g) and 30 g of water. Cover and allow the lau to steam for 8 minutes. This will give the vegetable a head start while cooking.","4. Once the lau is soft remove it from the pan and reserve in a bowl along with the juices.","5. Set the kadai back on the heat. Wipe it dry so that when you add oil to it, it doesn’t splatter.","6. Heat 20 g vegetable oil. Once hot, drop the dal’er bori and fry them till they are golden. This should take about 20 seconds. Drain them from the oil and set aside.","7. Before proceeding any further, mix 20 g water in the ginger paste and keep it ready.","8. Temper the same oil with bay leaves and mustard seeds.","9. Wait for the seeds to crackle before adding the ginger paste. Fry it for about 4 minutes.","10. Next, add the steamed lau along with the reserved juices. Mix everything well.","11. At this stage, also add the remaining salt (12 g) and all of the sugar. Also stir in the poppy paste.","12. Let everything bubble for about 6 minutes on medium heat.

Soak the poppy seeds in hot water for at least two hours. After that, grind them to a fine paste. When you rub some of the paste between your fingers, it should feel smooth, that is, the individual poppy seeds should not be discernable. The finer you grind the poppy seeds, the better the flavour.\n2. Peel the _lau_ and cut it into 3-mm-thick matchsticks.\n3. Set a pan on medium heat and add in the _lau_ along with half of the salt (about 10 g) and 30 g of water. Cover and allow the _lau_ to steam for 8 minutes. This will give the vegetable a head start while cooking.\n4. Once the _lau_ is soft remove it from the pan and reserve in a bowl along with the juices.\n5. Set the _kadai_ back on the heat. Wipe it dry so that when you add oil to it, it doesn’t splatter.\n6. Heat 20 g vegetable oil. Once hot, drop the _dal’er bori_ and fry them till they are golden. This should take about 20 seconds. Drain them from the oil and set aside.\n7. Before proceeding any further, mix 20 g water in the ginger paste and keep it ready.\n8. Temper the same oil with bay leaves and mustard seeds.\n9. Wait for the seeds to crackle before adding the ginger paste. Fry it for about 4 minutes.\n10. Next, add the steamed _lau_ along with the reserved juices. Mix everything well.\n11. At this stage, also add the remaining salt (12 g) and all of the sugar. Also stir in the poppy paste.\n11. Let everything bubble for about 6 minutes on medium heat. If you find that juices are running dry, drop the heat or cover the pan.\n12. Break the fried _bori_ into shards and add it to the shukto.\n13. Mix the flour into the milk and add that to the shukto too. The flour will help thicken the juices and allow them to coat the _lau_.\n14.

Place the flour in a bowl with the salt, sugar, and oil, and distribute the ingredients well by hand.\n2. Add the hot water.\n3. Set your timer for 10 minutes and knead the dough till it is soft and supple. The dough might seem a bit sticky at first, but take your time and knead it well, incorporating all the water.\n4. Cover the dough with either a lid, wet towel, or plastic wrap, and allow it to rest for at least 30 minutes.\n5. Portion the dough in 20 equal balls of 16–17 g each.\n6. Shape each portion of the dough into a round ball. Resting the dough for 5 minutes each before shaping and rolling will make the job easier.\n7. Roll each ball into a disc of about 10 cm in diameter. Beginners may roll out the _luchis_ between two sheets of well-oiled baking paper. This will help apply pressure evenly.\n8. Lower the discs into hot oil set over medium heat and fry the _luchis_ one at a time, gently patting their tops with the flat end of your frying spoon to make them puff.\n9. Drain the fried _luchis_ on a rack, colander, or over paper towels.\n\n## Served with\n- Chhola’r dal\n- Alu’r torkari\n- Shada phulkopi’r torkari\n- Alu’r dom\n- [Dim’er kosha](/recipe/dimer-dalna/)\n- [Kosha maangsho](/recipe/chicken-curry/)\n- Payesh\n","slug":"luchi","published":1,"updated":"2017-03-24T03:05:12.567Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjancyb1h002vncvhkdy4t51b","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A light, flaky, puffed-up, deep-fried, sublime bread</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">We share with you the tips and tricks to making the perfect <em>luchis</em>, including a special hack for beginners.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">L</span><em>uchis</em> are made from finely milled flour, as opposed to their close cousins, the <em>puris</em>, which are usually prepared with whole-wheat flour.

Take 1 kg milk in a heavy-bottom saucepan and set it to boil.","2. Once bubbling, stir in 45 g sugar.","3. Keep boiling the milk, while stirring it continuously, for about 90 minutes.","4. During this entire time, the pot should be on medium to low heat.","5. At regular intervals of 3–4 minutes, scrape the solids from the bottom and sides of the pot, and incorporate them into the boiling milk. This step, as well as the previous one, is crucial. We don’t want our kheer to burn at any point.","6. Once the milk has reduced and thickened (when you lift some of it on your spoon and drop it, it should falls in clumps), make a paste of ¾ tsp flour and 1 tbsp milk.","7. Add this paste to the pot. Stir and cook for another 5 minutes.","8. Divide the kheer into 10 portions of 20 g each.","9. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least two hours.","10. In a mixing bowl, take 200 g flour, 40 g ghee, and 4 g salt. Mix these ingredients well till they take on a bread-crumb texture. The idea is to distribute the fat among the flour particles, in order to make the pastry crisp and flaky.","11. Now, add in 80 g water.","12. Mix until the dough comes together. This is a tight dough, so don’t add more water even if it seems a bit dry at first.","13. Cover the dough and rest it for at least 20 minutes.","14. Once the kheer has chilled in the fridge for at least 2 hours, and the pastry dough is rested for at least 20 minutes, proceed to shaping each of them.","15. Shape each 20 g portion of kheer into 3 cm by 4 cm tablets. Put them back in the fridge to chill, till needed.","16. Divide the dough in 10 portions of 30 g each.","17. Shape each portion into a flat disc. Cover and rest, till needed.","18. This proportion—20 g kheer and 30 g dough—will give you the best filling to pastry ratio.","19.

Take 1 kg milk in a heavy-bottom saucepan and set it to boil.\n2. Once bubbling, stir in 45 g sugar.\n3. Keep boiling the milk, while stirring it continuously, for about 90 minutes.\n4. During this entire time, the pot should be on medium to low heat.\n5. At regular intervals of 3–4 minutes, scrape the solids from the bottom and sides of the pot, and incorporate them into the boiling milk. This step, as well as the previous one, is crucial. We don’t want our _kheer_ to burn at any point.\n6. Once the milk has reduced and thickened (when you lift some of it on your spoon and drop it, it should falls in clumps), make a paste of ¾ tsp flour and 1 tbsp milk.\n7. Add this paste to the pot. Stir and cook for another 5 minutes.\n8. Divide the _kheer_ into 10 portions of 20 g each.\n9. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least two hours.\n\n**STEP II—THE PASTRY DOUGH**\n1. In a mixing bowl, take 200 g flour, 40 g _ghee_, and 4 g salt. Mix these ingredients well till they take on a bread-crumb texture. The idea is to distribute the fat among the flour particles, in order to make the pastry crisp and flaky.\n2. Now, add in 80 g water.\n3. Mix until the dough comes together. This is a tight dough, so don’t add more water even if it seems a bit dry at first.\n4. Cover the dough and rest it for at least 20 minutes.\n\n**STEP III—SHAPING**\n1. Once the _kheer_ has chilled in the fridge for at least 2 hours, and the pastry dough is rested for at least 20 minutes, proceed to shaping each of them.\n2. Shape each 20 g portion of _kheer_ into 3 cm by 4 cm tablets. Put them back in the fridge to chill, till needed.\n3. Divide the dough in 10 portions of 30 g each.\n4. Shape each portion into a flat disc. Cover and rest, till needed.\n5. This proportion—20 g _kheer_ and 30 g dough—will give you the best filling to pastry ratio.\n\n**STEP IV—CONSTRUCTION**\n1. Roll each portion of the dough into a 14 cm disc, about 1 mm thick.\n2. Place a _kheer_ tablet at the centre of the disc.\n3. With your fingertips, apply water to the edges of the rolled pastry. This will act as a glue.\n4. Fold the opposite ends over one another, overlapping them. Press gently to seal.\n5. Turn the pastry over and apply water to the protruding wings. Fold them over each other, sealing them as you go.\n6. Use a clove to seal the topmost layer of the envelope in place.\n7. Follow these steps for all the pastries.\n\n**STEP V—THE SUGAR SYRUP**\n1. In a saucepan, add 400 g sugar and 200 g water.\n2. Cover with a lid, and set it on medium heat for about 10 minutes, or till the sugar syrup starts bubbling.\n3. For this recipe, we do not want a thick syrup. It should be the consistency of, say, packaged fruit juice.\n\n **STEP VI—THE SUGAR SYRUP**\n1. Heat oil in a frying pan to 150°C. The oil should be 5-cm deep.\n2. **_Lobongo lotika_ is not fried in hot oil like other deep-fried snacks or crisps. Since this pastry has a lot of layers of flour, we must fry it at low temperatures to ensure that all the layers cook through. If you try to fry it at a high temperature, the outside may look brown and done, but the inner layers will still be gummy.**\n3. Because of the slow frying, each batch of _lobongo lotika_ will take about 30 minutes to cook completely.  \n4. During this period, **turn them every five minutes** to ensure that the dough is getting cooked, and hardening, from both sides evenly. Otherwise, the _kheer_ may start to ooze out of the softer end.\n5. In case the filling leaks into the oil, you may remove the damaged pastry from the oil and put it inside an oven at 175°C for about 20 minutes.\n6. Once the pastries are golden-brown in colour, drain them from the oil and dunk them in the sugar syrup. Coat well, shake off the excess syrup, and place them on a plate to cool.  \n\n## Served with\n- Tea\n","source":"_posts/lobongo-lotika.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Lobongo Lotika\ntags:\n  - vegetarian\n  - snack\n  - sweets\ndescription: >-\n  Lobongo lotika is a flaky parcel, filled with kheer (sweetened, reduced milk), sealed with a clove, deep fried, and coated with sugar syrup.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1491526895/lobongo-lotika-website-thumbnail-_casq91.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: 7FiVDkUjkF4\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Lobongo Lotika\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1491526895/lobongo-lotika-website-thumbnail-_casq91.jpg\",\"description\":\"Lobongo lotika is a flaky parcel, filled with kheer (sweetened, reduced milk), sealed with a clove, deep fried, and coated with sugar syrup.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT30M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT180M\",\"recipeYield\":\"10 pieces\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"Whole milk 1 kg\",\"Sugar 445 g\",\"Water 280 g\",\"Maida (flour) 200 g\",\"Ghee 40 g\",\"Salt 4 g\",\"Vegetable oil (for deep frying) ~ 400 g\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

Finely dice the onions, and ginger, chop green chillies, and fresh coriander.\n5. Toast the peanuts in a pan till they are lightly coloured, and chop them roughly.\n6. Now, crack an egg in a bowl. Add in the cooked _keema_, onions, ginger, green chillies, coriander, peanuts, breads crumbs, and salt.\n7. Beat till all the ingredients are well combined.\n\n**PART III—ROLLING THE PASTRY**\n8. Oil your rolling surface and rolling pin.\n9. Place the dough on the surface and start rolling into a thin, rectangular sheet, about 2 mm thick, and 30 cm by 40 cm in dimension.\n\n**PART IV—BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER**\n10. In a frying pan, set over medium heat, pour vegetable oil till it reaches a height of about 3 cm from the bottom of the pan.    \n11. While the oil is heating up, place the filling in the centre of the rolled dough.\n12. Form an envelope by folding the sides of the rolled sheet inward, starting with the longer sides. Press down gently to seal.\n13. Now, fold the shorter sides such that the you have a pocket of filling, securely enclosed within the pastry sheet.\n14. Lower the _mughlai_ into the hot oil and fry on both sides till golden brown. Occasionally pat it down with the frying spoon to make sure that the filling is cooked thoroughly.\n15. Remove the _mughlai porota_ from the oil and place it on a chopping board. The residual heat will cook the egg to perfect doneness. Cut it into square segments and serve while still warm.\n\n## Served with\n- Alu’r torkari\n- Mutton or chicken kosha\n- Cabin-style salad\n- Ketchup\n","slug":"mughlai-porota","published":1,"updated":"2017-03-10T03:32:12.724Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjancyb1m0034ncvhcyypl45q","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A layered, deep-fried pastry filled with egg and minced meat</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Making this dish at home may seem like a daunting task.

Diced, chopped, or puréed onions won’t give you the same result. Using a mortar and pestle, crush together 10 g garlic and 20 g green chillies to a paste.

Keep the flame medium to low, depending on whether your onions are sticking to the pan or not, and stir often. We want to fry the spices as well as develop colour on the onions. Next, add the dry spices (coriander, cumin, and red chilli) mixed with 100 g of water. Continue frying the onions along with the spices for about 15 more minutes.

Fry the mutton, stirring frequently to check that it’s not sticking to the pan, for 15 minutes on high heat. Beat 150–200 g yoghurt until it is lump-free and add it to the pan. Also add 8 g salt and 10 g sugar at this point. Mix everything and keep frying. Once the moisture (from the cold mutton and yoghurt) starts to dry out, drop the heat to medium.","There’s not much to it now.

Also add about 4 slit green chillies for flavour. Cover and cook until the mutton is tender. You should be able to tear it apart with two fingers.","Turn off the heat and top off with a little bit of ghee. Cover and let it rest for about 2 minutes before serving."]},"_content":"\n<p class=\"post-byline\">Slow-cooked, rich, Bengali mutton curry</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">There are no special ingredients to making a good mutton _kosha_. All it takes is patience.</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">M</span>utton _kosha_ is an iconic Bengali delicacy. The word _kosha_ is similar in meaning to _bhuna_, which involves slowly cooking a gravy over low flame for a very long time to get a rich, dark-brown gravy and melt-in-the-mouth mutton pieces. It is worth pointing out that in Bengal, as well as in India, mutton is commonly used to refer to goat’s meat. Mutton _kosha_ (or _kosha mangsho_) can be served with _porota_ or _polao_. It tastes great even with plain rice. One of the most famous shops selling this style of mutton _kosha_ is Golbari at the Shyambazar crossing in Calcutta. While we are not certain that our version is exactly like Golbari’s, we can assure you it certainly tastes very good.\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 1.5 to 2 hours\n**YIELDS** 6 servings\n**calories** 560 kcal per serving\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|             Quantity | Ingredient                                       | \n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n|                 1 kg | Mutton                                           |\n| **FOR THE MARINADE** |                                                  |\n|                100 g | Onion                                            |\n|                  5 g | Garlic                                           |\n|                100 g | Yoghurt                                          |\n|                 15 g | Salt                                             |\n|                  5 g | Turmeric powder                                  |\n|                  3 g | Shahi garam masala powder                        |\n|    **FOR THE CURRY** |                                                  |\n|                 20 g | Mustard oil                                      |\n|                 4 cm | Cinnamon                                         |\n|               10 pcs | Green cardamom                                   |\n|                 1 pc | Black cardamom                                   |\n|               10 pcs | Cloves                                           |\n|                4 pcs | Dried red chillies                               |\n|                6 pcs | Bay leaves                                       |\n|                400 g | Onions (sliced)                                  |\n|                 40 g | Ginger paste                                     |\n|                 10 g | Garlic                                           |\n|                 20 g | Green chillies (plus 4 extra pieces for garnish) |\n|                  3 g | Coriander powder                                 |\n|                  3 g | Cumin powder                                     |\n|                  3 g | Kashmiri red chilli powder                       |\n|            150–200 g | Yoghurt (based on how tart you want your curry)  |\n|                  8 g | Salt                                             |\n|                 10 g | Sugar                                            |\n|             ~1 litre | Hot water                                        |\n|                  5 g | Ghee                                             |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Mortar and pestle\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan with lid\n-  _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Grinder\n- Electric kettle (optional)\n\n\n## Method\n1. For the marinade, add 100 g quartered onions, 5 g roughly chopped garlic, 100 g yoghurt, 15 g salt, turmeric, and shahi garam masala to a grinder jar. Blitz to form a smooth paste. \n2. Coat all the mutton pieces with the marinade, making sure to get into all the nooks and crannies of the meat. Cover and allow the mutton to marinate in the refrigerator for about 8 hours. \n3. Coming to the prep: Cut 400 g onions into thin slices. For this recipe, sliced onions define the texture of the curry. Diced, chopped, or puréed onions won’t give you the same result. Using a mortar and pestle, crush together 10 g garlic and 20 g green chillies to a paste. For ease while stirring later on, you may also cut all the bay leaves in 3-cm sections using a pair of scissors.\n4. Heat a large _kadai_ and add mustard oil to it. Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, add the dried red chillies, bay leaves, cinnamon, green cardamom, black cardamom, and cloves. \n5. Add the onions and fry them on medium flame for about 15 minutes until they are light brown in colour. Then, add the ginger paste, and garlic and green chilli paste, and fry for another 5 minutes. Keep the flame medium to low, depending on whether your onions are sticking to the pan or not, and stir often. We want to fry the spices as well as develop colour on the onions. Next, add the dry spices (coriander, cumin, and red chilli) mixed with 100 g of water. Continue frying the onions along with the spices for about 15 more minutes. By now (it’s been 30 minutes since we started), your onions should have taken on a reddish-brown colour and the spices started releasing their oils. \n6. Add the marinated mutton to the pan. The mutton has been in the fridge, so it is cold. Raise the heat and mix everything thoroughly. Fry the mutton, stirring frequently to check that it’s not sticking to the pan, for 15 minutes on high heat. Beat 150–200 g yoghurt until it is lump-free and add it to the pan. Also add 8 g salt and 10 g sugar at this point. Mix everything and keep frying. Once the moisture (from the cold mutton and yoghurt) starts to dry out, drop the heat to medium.\n7. There’s not much to it now. On medium heat, for the next 75 to 90 minutes,  repeat the following steps:\n  --Add a splash of _hot_ water to the pan (~30 ml at a time)\n  --Stir it in\n  --Cover the pan and cook for a minute\n  --Uncover and stir everything thoroughly <br>\n*What we’re doing here is a kind of controlled browning. Stir, scrape, and incorporate any of the browned bits that may have stuck to the bottom of the pan, as that is what will allow the mutton to develop a rich colour. However, be alert so that the gravy doesn’t burn and turn bitter. Keep adding water a little at a time and cooking the meat in the gravy.*\n8. Once you are happy with the colour, add as much water as you’d like for the gravy/curry. Also add about 4 slit green chillies for flavour. Cover and cook until the mutton is tender. You should be able to tear it apart with two fingers.\n9. Turn off the heat and top off with a little bit of ghee. Cover and let it rest for about 2 minutes before serving.\n\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- Polao\n- [Fried rice](/recipe/bengali-vegetable-fried-rice/)\n- Porota\n- [Luchi](/recipe/luchi/)\n\n\n\n","source":"_posts/mutton-kosha.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Mutton Kosha | Kosha Mangsho\ntags:\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\n  - kosha\n  - mutton\ndescription: >-\n  Mutton kosha—meat slowly cooked in gravy over low heat—is characterised by a\n  rich brown gravy and melt-in-the-mouth mutton pieces.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1508372733/kosha-mangsho-website-thumbnail-_p4nuue.png\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: CUCtn02Juk0\ndate: 2017-10-18 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Mutton Kosha or Kosha Mangsho\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1508372733/kosha-mangsho-website-thumbnail-_p4nuue.png\",\"description\":\"Mutton kosha—meat slowly cooked in gravy over low heat—is characterised by a rich brown gravy and melt-in-the-mouth mutton pieces.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT2H\",\"totalTime\":\"PT3H\",\"recipeYield\":\"6\",\"nutrition\":{\"@type\":\"NutritionInformation\",\"servingSize\":\"6 servings\",\"calories\":\"560 calories\",\"fatContent\":\"253 g\", \"carbohydrateContent\": \"80 g\", \"proteinContent\":\"186 g\"}, \"recipeIngredient\":[\"1 kg Mutton\",\"100 g Onion\",\"5 g Garlic\",\"100 g Yoghurt\",\"15 g Salt\",\"5 g Turmeric powder\",\"3 g Shahi garam masala powder\",\"20 g Mustard oil\",\"4 cm Cinnamon\",\"10 pcs Green cardamom\",\"1 pc Black cardamom\",\"10 pcs Cloves\",\"4 pcs Dried red chillies\",\"6 pcs Bay leaves\",\"400 g Onions (sliced)\",\"40 g Ginger paste\",\"10 g Garlic\",\"20 g Green chillies (plus 4 extra pieces for garnish)\",\"3 g Coriander powder\",\"3 g Cumin powder\",\"3 g Kashmiri red chilli powder\",\"150–200 g Yoghurt (based on how tart you want your curry)\",\"8 g Salt\",\"10 g Sugar\",\"~1 litre Hot water\",\"5 g Ghee\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"For the marinade, add 100 g quartered onions, 5 g roughly chopped garlic, 100 g yoghurt, 15 g salt, turmeric, and shahi garam masala to a grinder jar.

Divide the paneer into 3-cm cubes and smear it with ¼ tsp each of salt and turmeric. Heat a flat frying pan on medium heat. Once the pan is completely hot, add a millimetre of oil. Wait until the oil heats up fully and then place the paneer cubes in it in a single layer. Ensuring that the pan and oil are both hot will prevent the paneer from sticking to the pan. After about 45 seconds, flip the cubes and fry their opposite surfaces until they are golden. Fry just two of the surfaces, as frying all round will make the paneer rubbery and won’t allow absorption of curry later on. Remove from the oil and set aside.\n2. Peel and chop potatoes in 3-cm cubes. Cut the capsicum in 2-cm squares.\n3. Heat 15 g mustard oil in a _kadai_ until it starts smoking and changes colour to a pale yellow. Temper the oil with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds.\n4. Once the whole spices start crackling, add the potatoes. Cover and fry them on medium heat until the turn slightly golden (about 4 minutes).\n5. Meanwhile, make a paste with ginger, cumin powder, kashmiri red chilli powder, turmeric powder, and 100 g water. Add it to the pan and cook it along with the potatoes until the smell of raw spices is gone. This should take about 6 minutes. If you find that the spices have dried out, add a splash of hot water and continue frying.\n6. Add capsicum and 3 slit green chillies. Cover and cook for about 3 minutes until the capsicum softens.\n7. Whip the yoghurt until it is lump-free. _Lower_ the heat and add it to the pan. Stir quickly prevent the yoghurt from splitting. Cook _uncovered_ for 2 minutes.\n8. Add the blanched peas (if you’re using raw peas, add them along with the potatoes earlier on) and sugar, and cook for 2 more minutes. \n9. Now add 250 g hot water to the pan. This will form the curry. Once it comes to a boil, drop the chunks of fried paneer in it. Bubble on medium heat for about 6 minutes until the curry thickens.\n10.

By some accounts, Calcutta is estimated to have under 5,000 'Bohris'. Mostly traders and businessfolk, the earliest settlers arrived in the city from western parts of India in the late 1800s</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">K</span>_hichro_ is a typically Bohra Muslim preparation. Like the more popular _haleem_ found in Calcutta during Ramzan, _khichro_ is made by slowly cooking meat and grains together till the meat falls off the bone. _Khichro_ is a special dish, being most prominently consumed communally on the tenth day of Muharram by Bohras across the globe, but it is also a very homely preparation, eaten throughout the year. It is deceptively light. In spite of the fact that a lot of onions, spices, meat, milk, and ghee goes into the dish, it is, underneath all that, a very hearty porridge of various kinds of grains. The _khichro_ is distinctive in that it is pale in colour; it doesn’t make use of turmeric powder, chilli powder, jeera powder, and other such spices. Apart from meat, its main ingredient is broken wheat (dalia can also be used), whereas _haleem_ is made predominantly with a mixture of dals.\n\n| Day 1                             | Day 2                        |  \n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Soaking grains                    | Chopping meat                |\n| Making _birasta_                  | Cooking grains               |\n| Cooking meat                      | Blending everything together |\n| Separating meat, stock, and bones | Garnishing                   |\n\n\n**COOKING TIME** 5 hours   \n**YIELDS** 6 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|         Quantity | Ingredient                            |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|       **GRAINS** |                                       |\n|            180 g | Broken wheat or dalia                 |\n|             30 g | Masoor dal                            |\n|             30 g | Moong dal                             |\n|             30 g | Chhola’r dal                          |\n|             30 g | Rice                                  |\n| **FOR THE MEAT** |                                       |\n|            800 g | Beef (or any red meat of your choice) |\n|             1 kg | Onions                                |\n|             15 g | Ginger                                |\n|             10 g | Garlic                                |\n|             10 g | Green chillies                        |\n|            6 pcs | Cardamom (whole)                      |\n|            2 pcs | Cinnamon (whole)                      |\n|            6 pcs | Cloves (whole)                        |\n|           10 pcs | Peppercorns                           |\n|            2 pcs | Bay leaves                            |\n|              3 g | [Shahi garam masala powder](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/)             |\n|             33 g | Salt                                  |\n|      **LIQUIDS** |                                       |\n|           1.5 kg | Water                                 |\n|            650 g | Milk                                  |\n|          **FAT** |                                       |\n|            250 g | Vegetable oil                         |\n|             50 g | Ghee                                  |\n|      **GARNISH** |                                       |\n|          1 bunch | Mint leaves                           |\n|             40 g | Ginger                                |\n|        12 wedges | Lime                                  |\n|            6 pcs | Green chillies                        |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Large dish or pot (for soaking grains)\n- Heavy-bottomed boiling pot with lid\n- Pressure cooker\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- _Khhunti_ | long stapula\n- _Jhhajhhri_ | perforated frying spoon\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Grinder\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—SOAKING GRAINS**\n1. Take the broken wheat, dals, and rice in a bowl. Rinse them well and soak overnight, for at least 12 hours.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING ONIONS (_BIRASTA_)**\n1. Slice 650g onions thinly, cutting off the root that holds the bulb together.\n2. Using you hand, scrunch up the slices to separate each layer. Chopping off the root will ensure that each strand separates from the rest.\n3. Heat vegetable oil, 3 cm deep, on medium heat. Once hot, drop a handful of the onion slices. Be sure not to overcrowd the pan; the onions must fry in a single layer.\n4. Using a fork, move the onions around every so often so that they fry evenly.\n5. Just as the onions start to turn golden (do not wait until they have already turned golden), start removing them from the pan and draining them over a perforated vessel such as a colander or _jhuri_. Keep a close watch, as the onions tend to burn very quickly towards the end. Remove them from the oil _before_ they have taken on the desired colour; they will continue to cook in the residual heat.\n6. Allow them to cool and crisp up. This caramelised onion is called _birasta_ and it is used in several Mughlai preparations. Raw onions weighing 650 g should yield about 165 g _birasta_ (so about 25 per cent the weight of raw onions). It can be stored in an airtight container for 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n**STEP III—COOKING MEAT**\n1. Using a grinder or mortar and pestle, form a smooth paste of 15 g ginger, 10 g garlic, and 10 g green chillies. Set aside.\n2. In a _kadai_, heat 35 g vegetable oil. Once hot, fry the meat in batches, from all sides, till it is golden. Browning the meat enhances the flavour of the dish.\n3. Remove from the pan and set aside.\n4. Temper the same oil with bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns.\n5. Add 350 g sliced onions, along with 15 g salt. Stirring intermittently, fry on medium heat for about 10 minutes till the onions turn brown.\n6. Next, add in the ginger-garlic-green-chilli paste and fry for another 3 minutes, until the smell of the raw spices is gone.\n7. Add [_Shahi garam masala_](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/) powder and 35 g of the _birasta_ we prepared earlier. Using a combination of sautéed and caramelised onions adds a depth of flavour to the preparation.\n8. Add the browned pieces of meat to the onion mixture and sauté for about 2 minutes.\n10. Transfer everything from the _kadai_ to a pressure cooker. Add 1.5 kg of water, close the lid, and pressure cook for about 1 hour. The meat should be completely soft by this stage, such that it easily falls off the bone.\n\n**STEP IV—SEPARATING MEAT, BROTH, AND BONES**\n1. Pick out the meat pieces from the pressure cooker. Just as they are cool enough to handle, remove the bones, cartilage, and any hard, unrendered collagen that is still in the meat. Discard these, along with the bay leaves.\n2. You should now be left with a gorgeous meaty broth, and some boneless pieces of tender meat. At this stage, you can put the meat and broth in the fridge and complete the rest of the preparation the following day.\n\n**STEP V—CHOPPING MEAT**\n1. Chop the meat, against the grain, into 3-cm chunks. Chilling the meat before chopping hardens the collagen rendered from the meat, making it easy to cut into cubes.\n2. Divide the meat into two piles. The first will be ground along with the grains, and the second added whole to the haleem towards the end.\n\n**STEP VI—BOILING GRAINS**\n1. Strain the water from the soaked grains, and transfer the latter to a heavy-bottomed pan. Add the broth we prepared earlier to the pan. (If you placed the broth in the fridge overnight, do not forget to first bring it to  boil before adding it to the grains.)\n2. Also add 18 g of salt and the first pile of the chopped meat.\n3. On low heat, let it all bubble for at least one hour, stirring occasionally, till the the grains are soft. Boiling the grains in the broth rather than in water intensifies the meaty flavour of the dish.\n\n**STEP VII—BLENDING EVERYTHING**\n1. Transfer the boiled grains into a blender and grind till everything breaks down. However, be careful not to reduce everything to a uniform, smooth paste, as we want some semblance of texture. Depending on the size of your blender jar, you may have to do this in batches.\n2. Return the _haleem_ to the pan. Add the remaining chunks of meat, along with 650 g hot milk. Mix until uniform. Bring to a boil before turning off the heat.\n\n**STEP VIII—GARNISHING**\n1. For the garnish, julienne some ginger, cut limes into wedges, split green chillies lengthwise, and finely chop the mint leaves.\n2. Drop ladles of the _haleem_ into a serving dish. Top it with a generous amount of _birasta_ and chopped mint leaves.\n3. Heat a pan till it is extremely hot. Add a spoonful of ghee and wait for it to smoke. Then add some julienned ginger and split green chillies.

Like the more popular _haleem_ found in Calcutta during Ramzan, _khichro_ is made by slowly cooking meat and grains together till the meat falls off the bone. _Khichro_ is a special dish, being most prominently consumed communally on the tenth day of Muharram by Bohras across the globe, but it is also a very homely preparation, eaten throughout the year. It is deceptively light. In spite of the fact that a lot of onions, spices, meat, milk, and ghee goes into the dish, it is, underneath all that, a very hearty porridge of various kinds of grains. The _khichro_ is distinctive in that it is pale in colour; it doesn’t make use of turmeric powder, chilli powder, jeera powder, and other such spices. Apart from meat, its main ingredient is broken wheat (dalia can also be used), whereas _haleem_ is made predominantly with a mixture of dals.\n\n| Day 1                             | Day 2                        |  \n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Soaking grains                    | Chopping meat                |\n| Making _birasta_                  | Cooking grains               |\n| Cooking meat                      | Blending everything together |\n| Separating meat, stock, and bones | Garnishing                   |\n\n\n**COOKING TIME** 5 hours   \n**YIELDS** 6 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|         Quantity | Ingredient                            |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|       **GRAINS** |                                       |\n|            180 g | Broken wheat or dalia                 |\n|             30 g | Masoor dal                            |\n|             30 g | Moong dal                             |\n|             30 g | Chhola’r dal                          |\n|             30 g | Rice                                  |\n| **FOR THE MEAT** |                                       |\n|            800 g | Beef (or any red meat of your choice) |\n|             1 kg | Onions                                |\n|             15 g | Ginger                                |\n|             10 g | Garlic                                |\n|             10 g | Green chillies                        |\n|            6 pcs | Cardamom (whole)                      |\n|            2 pcs | Cinnamon (whole)                      |\n|            6 pcs | Cloves (whole)                        |\n|           10 pcs | Peppercorns                           |\n|            2 pcs | Bay leaves                            |\n|              3 g | [Shahi garam masala powder](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/)             |\n|             33 g | Salt                                  |\n|      **LIQUIDS** |                                       |\n|           1.5 kg | Water                                 |\n|            650 g | Milk                                  |\n|          **FAT** |                                       |\n|            250 g | Vegetable oil                         |\n|             50 g | Ghee                                  |\n|      **GARNISH** |                                       |\n|          1 bunch | Mint leaves                           |\n|             40 g | Ginger                                |\n|        12 wedges | Lime                                  |\n|            6 pcs | Green chillies                        |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Large dish or pot (for soaking grains)\n- Heavy-bottomed boiling pot with lid\n- Pressure cooker\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- _Khhunti_ | long stapula\n- _Jhhajhhri_ | perforated frying spoon\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Grinder\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—SOAKING GRAINS**\n1. Take the broken wheat, dals, and rice in a bowl. Rinse them well and soak overnight, for at least 12 hours.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING ONIONS (_BIRASTA_)**\n1. Slice 650g onions thinly, cutting off the root that holds the bulb together.\n2. Using you hand, scrunch up the slices to separate each layer. Chopping off the root will ensure that each strand separates from the rest.\n3. Heat vegetable oil, 3 cm deep, on medium heat. Once hot, drop a handful of the onion slices. Be sure not to overcrowd the pan; the onions must fry in a single layer.\n4. Using a fork, move the onions around every so often so that they fry evenly.\n5. Just as the onions start to turn golden (do not wait until they have already turned golden), start removing them from the pan and draining them over a perforated vessel such as a colander or _jhuri_. Keep a close watch, as the onions tend to burn very quickly towards the end. Remove them from the oil _before_ they have taken on the desired colour; they will continue to cook in the residual heat.\n6. Allow them to cool and crisp up. This caramelised onion is called _birasta_ and it is used in several Mughlai preparations. Raw onions weighing 650 g should yield about 165 g _birasta_ (so about 25 per cent the weight of raw onions). It can be stored in an airtight container for 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n**STEP III—COOKING MEAT**\n1. Using a grinder or mortar and pestle, form a smooth paste of 15 g ginger, 10 g garlic, and 10 g green chillies. Set aside.\n2. In a _kadai_, heat 35 g vegetable oil. Once hot, fry the meat in batches, from all sides, till it is golden. Browning the meat enhances the flavour of the dish.\n3. Remove from the pan and set aside.\n4. Temper the same oil with bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns.\n5. Add 350 g sliced onions, along with 15 g salt. Stirring intermittently, fry on medium heat for about 10 minutes till the onions turn brown.\n6. Next, add in the ginger-garlic-green-chilli paste and fry for another 3 minutes, until the smell of the raw spices is gone.\n7. Add [_Shahi garam masala_](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/) powder and 35 g of the _birasta_ we prepared earlier. Using a combination of sautéed and caramelised onions adds a depth of flavour to the preparation.\n8. Add the browned pieces of meat to the onion mixture and sauté for about 2 minutes.\n10. Transfer everything from the _kadai_ to a pressure cooker. Add 1.5 kg of water, close the lid, and pressure cook for about 1 hour. The meat should be completely soft by this stage, such that it easily falls off the bone.\n\n**STEP IV—SEPARATING MEAT, BROTH, AND BONES**\n1. Pick out the meat pieces from the pressure cooker. Just as they are cool enough to handle, remove the bones, cartilage, and any hard, unrendered collagen that is still in the meat. Discard these, along with the bay leaves.\n2. You should now be left with a gorgeous meaty broth, and some boneless pieces of tender meat. At this stage, you can put the meat and broth in the fridge and complete the rest of the preparation the following day.\n\n**STEP V—CHOPPING MEAT**\n1. Chop the meat, against the grain, into 3-cm chunks. Chilling the meat before chopping hardens the collagen rendered from the meat, making it easy to cut into cubes.\n2. Divide the meat into two piles. The first will be ground along with the grains, and the second added whole to the haleem towards the end.\n\n**STEP VI—BOILING GRAINS**\n1. Strain the water from the soaked grains, and transfer the latter to a heavy-bottomed pan. Add the broth we prepared earlier to the pan. (If you placed the broth in the fridge overnight, do not forget to first bring it to  boil before adding it to the grains.)\n2. Also add 18 g of salt and the first pile of the chopped meat.\n3. On low heat, let it all bubble for at least one hour, stirring occasionally, till the the grains are soft. Boiling the grains in the broth rather than in water intensifies the meaty flavour of the dish.\n\n**STEP VII—BLENDING EVERYTHING**\n1. Transfer the boiled grains into a blender and grind till everything breaks down. However, be careful not to reduce everything to a uniform, smooth paste, as we want some semblance of texture. Depending on the size of your blender jar, you may have to do this in batches.\n2. Return the _haleem_ to the pan. Add the remaining chunks of meat, along with 650 g hot milk. Mix until uniform. Bring to a boil before turning off the heat.\n\n**STEP VIII—GARNISHING**\n1. For the garnish, julienne some ginger, cut limes into wedges, split green chillies lengthwise, and finely chop the mint leaves.\n2. Drop ladles of the _haleem_ into a serving dish. Top it with a generous amount of _birasta_ and chopped mint leaves.\n3. Heat a pan till it is extremely hot. Add a spoonful of ghee and wait for it to smoke. Then add some julienned ginger and split green chillies. Fry for about 5 seconds and pour the contents of the pan (along with the ghee) over the serving dish.\n\n\n## Served with\n- Bread rolls\n","slug":"khichra-bohra-haleem","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-17T06:35:22.907Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjancyb2c003rncvhr23grwgm","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A slow-cooked stew of meat, grains, and pulses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Of the many migrant communities that make up the rich tapestry of Calcutta’s modern history, the Bohra Muslims might not be the most visible, but they are a thriving culture.

By some accounts, Calcutta is estimated to have under 5,000 ‘Bohris’. Mostly traders and businessfolk, the earliest settlers arrived in the city from western parts of India in the late 1800s</p>","more":"<p><span class=\"dropcap\">K</span><em>hichro</em> is a typically Bohra Muslim preparation. Like the more popular <em>haleem</em> found in Calcutta during Ramzan, <em>khichro</em> is made by slowly cooking meat and grains together till the meat falls off the bone. <em>Khichro</em> is a special dish, being most prominently consumed communally on the tenth day of Muharram by Bohras across the globe, but it is also a very homely preparation, eaten throughout the year. It is deceptively light. In spite of the fact that a lot of onions, spices, meat, milk, and ghee goes into the dish, it is, underneath all that, a very hearty porridge of various kinds of grains. The <em>khichro</em> is distinctive in that it is pale in colour; it doesn’t make use of turmeric powder, chilli powder, jeera powder, and other such spices. Apart from meat, its main ingredient is broken wheat (dalia can also be used), whereas <em>haleem</em> is made predominantly with a mixture of dals.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Day 1</th>\n<th>Day 2</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Soaking grains</td>\n<td>Chopping meat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Making <em>birasta</em></td>\n<td>Cooking grains</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cooking meat</td>\n<td>Blending everything together</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Separating meat, stock, and bones</td>\n<td>Garnishing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 5 hours<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 6 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>GRAINS</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>180 g</td>\n<td>Broken wheat or dalia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30 g</td>\n<td>Masoor dal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30 g</td>\n<td>Moong dal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30 g</td>\n<td>Chhola’r dal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30 g</td>\n<td>Rice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR THE MEAT</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>800 g</td>\n<td>Beef (or any red meat of your choice)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 kg</td>\n<td>Onions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Ginger</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Garlic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Green chillies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 pcs</td>\n<td>Cardamom (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 pcs</td>\n<td>Cinnamon (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 pcs</td>\n<td>Cloves (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 pcs</td>\n<td>Peppercorns</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 pcs</td>\n<td>Bay leaves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 g</td>\n<td><a href=\"/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/\">Shahi garam masala powder</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>33 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>LIQUIDS</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1.5 kg</td>\n<td>Water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>650 g</td>\n<td>Milk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FAT</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>250 g</td>\n<td>Vegetable oil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50 g</td>\n<td>Ghee</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>GARNISH</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 bunch</td>\n<td>Mint leaves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>40 g</td>\n<td>Ginger</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12 wedges</td>\n<td>Lime</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 pcs</td>\n<td>Green chillies</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Large dish or pot (for soaking grains)</li>\n<li>Heavy-bottomed boiling pot with lid</li>\n<li>Pressure cooker</li>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan</li>\n<li><em>Khhunti</em> | long stapula</li>\n<li><em>Jhhajhhri</em> | perforated frying spoon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Grinder</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><p><strong>STEP I—SOAKING GRAINS</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take the broken wheat, dals, and rice in a bowl. Rinse them well and soak overnight, for at least 12 hours.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>STEP II—FRYING ONIONS (<em>BIRASTA</em>)</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Slice 650g onions thinly, cutting off the root that holds the bulb together.</li>\n<li>Using you hand, scrunch up the slices to separate each layer. Chopping off the root will ensure that each strand separates from the rest.</li>\n<li>Heat vegetable oil, 3 cm deep, on medium heat. Once hot, drop a handful of the onion slices. Be sure not to overcrowd the pan; the onions must fry in a single layer.</li>\n<li>Using a fork, move the onions around every so often so that they fry evenly.</li>\n<li>Just as the onions start to turn golden (do not wait until they have already turned golden), start removing them from the pan and draining them over a perforated vessel such as a colander or <em>jhuri</em>. Keep a close watch, as the onions tend to burn very quickly towards the end. Remove them from the oil <em>before</em> they have taken on the desired colour; they will continue to cook in the residual heat.</li>\n<li>Allow them to cool and crisp up. This caramelised onion is called <em>birasta</em> and it is used in several Mughlai preparations. Raw onions weighing 650 g should yield about 165 g <em>birasta</em> (so about 25 per cent the weight of raw onions). It can be stored in an airtight container for 2 to 3 weeks.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>STEP III—COOKING MEAT</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Using a grinder or mortar and pestle, form a smooth paste of 15 g ginger, 10 g garlic, and 10 g green chillies. Set aside.</li>\n<li>In a <em>kadai</em>, heat 35 g vegetable oil. Once hot, fry the meat in batches, from all sides, till it is golden. Browning the meat enhances the flavour of the dish.</li>\n<li>Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>\n<li>Temper the same oil with bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns.</li>\n<li>Add 350 g sliced onions, along with 15 g salt. Stirring intermittently, fry on medium heat for about 10 minutes till the onions turn brown.</li>\n<li>Next, add in the ginger-garlic-green-chilli paste and fry for another 3 minutes, until the smell of the raw spices is gone.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/\"><em>Shahi garam masala</em></a> powder and 35 g of the <em>birasta</em> we prepared earlier. Using a combination of sautéed and caramelised onions adds a depth of flavour to the preparation.</li>\n<li>Add the browned pieces of meat to the onion mixture and sauté for about 2 minutes.</li>\n<li>Transfer everything from the <em>kadai</em> to a pressure cooker. Add 1.5 kg of water, close the lid, and pressure cook for about 1 hour. The meat should be completely soft by this stage, such that it easily falls off the bone.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>STEP IV—SEPARATING MEAT, BROTH, AND BONES</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick out the meat pieces from the pressure cooker. Just as they are cool enough to handle, remove the bones, cartilage, and any hard, unrendered collagen that is still in the meat. Discard these, along with the bay leaves.</li>\n<li>You should now be left with a gorgeous meaty broth, and some boneless pieces of tender meat. At this stage, you can put the meat and broth in the fridge and complete the rest of the preparation the following day.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>STEP V—CHOPPING MEAT</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Chop the meat, against the grain, into 3-cm chunks. Chilling the meat before chopping hardens the collagen rendered from the meat, making it easy to cut into cubes.</li>\n<li>Divide the meat into two piles. The first will be ground along with the grains, and the second added whole to the haleem towards the end.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>STEP VI—BOILING GRAINS</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Strain the water from the soaked grains, and transfer the latter to a heavy-bottomed pan. Add the broth we prepared earlier to the pan. (If you placed the broth in the fridge overnight, do not forget to first bring it to  boil before adding it to the grains.)</li>\n<li>Also add 18 g of salt and the first pile of the chopped meat.</li>\n<li>On low heat, let it all bubble for at least one hour, stirring occasionally, till the the grains are soft. Boiling the grains in the broth rather than in water intensifies the meaty flavour of the dish.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>STEP VII—BLENDING EVERYTHING</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Transfer the boiled grains into a blender and grind till everything breaks down. However, be careful not to reduce everything to a uniform, smooth paste, as we want some semblance of texture. Depending on the size of your blender jar, you may have to do this in batches.</li>\n<li>Return the <em>haleem</em> to the pan. Add the remaining chunks of meat, along with 650 g hot milk. Mix until uniform. Bring to a boil before turning off the heat.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>STEP VIII—GARNISHING</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>For the garnish, julienne some ginger, cut limes into wedges, split green chillies lengthwise, and finely chop the mint leaves.</li>\n<li>Drop ladles of the <em>haleem</em> into a serving dish.

This is not a preparation in which you spice up things with ginger or cumin powder or red chilli powder. The only spice this recipe calls for is a touch of turmeric. Mostly, it relies on the salt and sugar to help draw out the moisture from the vegetables, and allow their flavours to mingle while cooked together. We don’t add water to form a gravy. Rather we cook this _torkari_ on low heat, with the lid on, for nearly 30 to 40 minutes. At the end of this slow cooking process, it reaches a state where no vegetable stands out, yet each has still held on to its flavours and integrity.\n\nComing to the selection of the veggies themselves, some type of starchy item such as a potato or sweet potato is used. These, being otherwise neutral in taste, are the perfect receptacle of the juices from the other vegetables. The mushy texture is usually contributed by pumpkin, while radish is used for the more sharper notes. Some kind of beans (such as _borboti_ or _sheem_) add crunch and colour. In the winter months, cauliflower lends the most sublime flavour to the _torkari_, in addition to providing texture. Finally, slimier vegetables such as brinjals, or cabbage or leafy greens that are prone to wilting on application of heat and salt, coat the mix with their juices and hold everything together.\n\nThere are several versions of _panchmishali torkari_. The choice of _phoron_ (or tempering) will depend on the vegetables used. In this particular recipe, we are using potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_ (yardlong beans), cabbage, and brinjal, with a tempering of _panch phoron_.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 60 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|               Quantity | Ingredient                                |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **OIL**                |                                           |\n|                   40 g | Mustard oil                               |\n| **TEMPERING (PHORON)** |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Bay leaves (whole)                        |\n|               2 pieces | Dried red chillies (whole)                |\n|                1 piece | Green chilli (slit)                       |\n|                  1 tsp | Panch phoron                              |\n| **THE VEGETABLES**     |                                           |\n|                  100 g | Brinjals (5-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  200 g | Potatoes (4-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  100 g | Sweet potatoes (4-cm cubes)               |\n|                  200 g | Pumpkin (4-cm cubes)                      |\n|                  200 g | Cauliflower (5-cm florets)                |\n|                  100 g | Borboti or yardlong beans (5-cm segments) |\n|                  100 g | Cabbage (5-cm segments)                   |\n| **THE SEASONING**      |                                           |\n|                  ½ tsp | Turmeric powder                           |\n|                   12 g | Salt                                      |\n|                   25 g | Sugar                                     |\n| **THE GARNISH**        |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Green chillies (slit)                     |\n|                   10 g | Coriander leaves (chopped)                |\n|                  ½ tsp | Bhaja masala                              |\n|                    5 g | Ghee                                      |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- Lid for the cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Peel and cut the potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin in 4 cm cubes.\n2. Cut the _borboti_, brinjal, and cabbage in segments of 5 cm each.\n3. Cut the cauliflower in florets, 5 cm large.\n4. In order to cook _panchmishali torkari_, the vegetables are stir-fried, and the order in which they are added to the pan depends upon their hardness. So, the potatoes and sweet potatoes, which are the hardest of all the veggies, are the first to enter the pan, followed by pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_, and cabbage. We deal with the brinjals separately, as explained in the next step.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Heat mustard oil in a pan till it starts to smoke lightly and the pungent smell is gone.\n2. Keeping the pan on medium heat, add in the brinjals and fry them for about 3 minutes till they are golden.\n3. Remove them from pan and reserve for later use. Frying the brinjals separately enhances their flavour.\n4. Now, in the same oil, add the tempering of dried red chillies, bay leaves, green chilli, and _panch phoron_. _Panch phoron_ is a mix of the following whole spices in equal proportion: fenugreek seeds (_methi_), fennel seeds (_mouri_), mustard seeds (_shorshe_), nigella seeds (_kaalo jeere_), and a typically Bengali spice called _radhuni_.\n5. Once the spices start to crackle, add in the potatoes and sweet potatoes to the oil.\n6. Fry these for about 3 minutes before introducing the next vegetable, that is, pumpkin.\n7. Fry the pumpkin, sweet potatoes, and potatoes together for another 3 minutes before adding the cauliflower. Basically, at intervals of 3 minutes, we add the next vegetable and stir-fry it together with the veggies already in the pan.\n8. Once the cauliflower is fried, add the _borboti_, and then, after 3 minutes, the cabbage.\n\n**STEP III—STEAMING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Once all the veggies have been fried, add in the salt and turmeric, and stir them in.\n2. At this point, lower the heat and cover the pan with a lid. The salt will help release the moisture from the vegetables, and gently steaming them with the lid on will help soften them up.\n3. Cook the vegetables like this for about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan. While doing so, be gentle, as the we don’t want the vegetables to turn into mush. (Always use a folding motion to stir the veggies around.)\n4. After 15 minutes, add the sugar and the fried brinjals, and cover and cook for another 10 minutes or so, stirring occasionally.\n5. You will know that the _torkari_ is done when the vegetables are completely tender and have integrated themselves into the dish, but still have the integrity to not fall apart to the touch.\n6. At this point, garnish with the chopped coriander leaves, green chillies, _bhaja masala_, and _ghee_.\n7. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and allow it to rest for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | Roti\n","source":"_posts/panchmishali-torkari.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Panchmishali Torkari\ndescription: Video recipe of authentic, vegetarian Bengali dish of cauliflower, beans, sweet potatoes, eggplants, cooked with panch phoron tempering.\ntags:\n  - vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\n  - torkari\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1485389957/website-thumbnail-panchmishalitorkari_t7jruj.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: DWY8qtUC9K0\ndate: 2017-01-26 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Panchmishali Torkari\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1485389957/thumbnail-small-panchmishalitorkari_pexgac.jpg\",\"description\":\"Panchmishali torkari is any Bengali mixed-vegetable preparation, in which the vegetables are first stir-fried and then steamed in their own juices till they are tender and well-integrated.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT20M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT60M\",\"recipeYield\":\"5 servings\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"40 g  Mustard oil\",\"2 pieces  Bay leaves (whole)\",\"2 pieces  Dried red chillies (whole)\",\"1 piece  Green chilli (slit)\",\"1 tsp  Panch phoron\",\"100 g  Brinjals (5-cm cubes)\",\"200 g  Potatoes (4-cm cubes)\",\"100 g  Sweet potatoes (4-cm cubes)\",\"200 g  Pumpkin (4-cm cubes)\",\"200 g  Cauliflower (5-cm florets)\",\"100 g  Borboti or yardlong beans (5-cm segments)\",\"100 g  Cabbage (5-cm segments)\",\"½ tsp  Turmeric powder\",\"12 g  Salt\",\"25 g  Sugar\",\"2 pieces  Green chillies (slit)\",\"10 g  Coriander leaves (chopped)\",\"½ tsp  Bhaja masala\",\"5 g  Ghee\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

This is not a preparation in which you spice up things with ginger or cumin powder or red chilli powder. The only spice this recipe calls for is a touch of turmeric. Mostly, it relies on the salt and sugar to help draw out the moisture from the vegetables, and allow their flavours to mingle while cooked together. We don’t add water to form a gravy. Rather we cook this _torkari_ on low heat, with the lid on, for nearly 30 to 40 minutes. At the end of this slow cooking process, it reaches a state where no vegetable stands out, yet each has still held on to its flavours and integrity.\n\nComing to the selection of the veggies themselves, some type of starchy item such as a potato or sweet potato is used. These, being otherwise neutral in taste, are the perfect receptacle of the juices from the other vegetables. The mushy texture is usually contributed by pumpkin, while radish is used for the more sharper notes. Some kind of beans (such as _borboti_ or _sheem_) add crunch and colour. In the winter months, cauliflower lends the most sublime flavour to the _torkari_, in addition to providing texture. Finally, slimier vegetables such as brinjals, or cabbage or leafy greens that are prone to wilting on application of heat and salt, coat the mix with their juices and hold everything together.\n\nThere are several versions of _panchmishali torkari_. The choice of _phoron_ (or tempering) will depend on the vegetables used. In this particular recipe, we are using potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_ (yardlong beans), cabbage, and brinjal, with a tempering of _panch phoron_.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 60 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|               Quantity | Ingredient                                |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **OIL**                |                                           |\n|                   40 g | Mustard oil                               |\n| **TEMPERING (PHORON)** |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Bay leaves (whole)                        |\n|               2 pieces | Dried red chillies (whole)                |\n|                1 piece | Green chilli (slit)                       |\n|                  1 tsp | Panch phoron                              |\n| **THE VEGETABLES**     |                                           |\n|                  100 g | Brinjals (5-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  200 g | Potatoes (4-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  100 g | Sweet potatoes (4-cm cubes)               |\n|                  200 g | Pumpkin (4-cm cubes)                      |\n|                  200 g | Cauliflower (5-cm florets)                |\n|                  100 g | Borboti or yardlong beans (5-cm segments) |\n|                  100 g | Cabbage (5-cm segments)                   |\n| **THE SEASONING**      |                                           |\n|                  ½ tsp | Turmeric powder                           |\n|                   12 g | Salt                                      |\n|                   25 g | Sugar                                     |\n| **THE GARNISH**        |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Green chillies (slit)                     |\n|                   10 g | Coriander leaves (chopped)                |\n|                  ½ tsp | Bhaja masala                              |\n|                    5 g | Ghee                                      |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- Lid for the cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Peel and cut the potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin in 4 cm cubes.\n2. Cut the _borboti_, brinjal, and cabbage in segments of 5 cm each.\n3. Cut the cauliflower in florets, 5 cm large.\n4. In order to cook _panchmishali torkari_, the vegetables are stir-fried, and the order in which they are added to the pan depends upon their hardness. So, the potatoes and sweet potatoes, which are the hardest of all the veggies, are the first to enter the pan, followed by pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_, and cabbage. We deal with the brinjals separately, as explained in the next step.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Heat mustard oil in a pan till it starts to smoke lightly and the pungent smell is gone.\n2. Keeping the pan on medium heat, add in the brinjals and fry them for about 3 minutes till they are golden.\n3. Remove them from pan and reserve for later use.

Fry the pumpkin, sweet potatoes, and potatoes together for another 3 minutes before adding the cauliflower. Basically, at intervals of 3 minutes, we add the next vegetable and stir-fry it together with the veggies already in the pan.\n8. Once the cauliflower is fried, add the _borboti_, and then, after 3 minutes, the cabbage.\n\n**STEP III—STEAMING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Once all the veggies have been fried, add in the salt and turmeric, and stir them in.\n2. At this point, lower the heat and cover the pan with a lid. The salt will help release the moisture from the vegetables, and gently steaming them with the lid on will help soften them up.\n3. Cook the vegetables like this for about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan. While doing so, be gentle, as the we don’t want the vegetables to turn into mush. (Always use a folding motion to stir the veggies around.)\n4. After 15 minutes, add the sugar and the fried brinjals, and cover and cook for another 10 minutes or so, stirring occasionally.\n5. You will know that the _torkari_ is done when the vegetables are completely tender and have integrated themselves into the dish, but still have the integrity to not fall apart to the touch.\n6. At this point, garnish with the chopped coriander leaves, green chillies, _bhaja masala_, and _ghee_.\n7. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and allow it to rest for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | Roti\n","slug":"panchmishali-torkari","published":1,"updated":"2017-03-03T06:15:23.172Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjancyb2e003uncvho7ktff9r","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">Simple Bengali mixed veggies with <em>panch phoron</em> tempering</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\"><em>Panchmishali torkari</em> is any Bengali mixed-vegetable preparation, in which the vegetables are first stir-fried and then steamed in their own juices till they are tender and well-integrated.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">A</span>s you might have guessed, the stars of this dish are the veggies themselves.

It shares many of the characteristics of other eastern societies that developed around wet rice cultivation—a method that dates back to the Neolithic ages. India is the largest cultivator of paddy in the world, and West Bengal grows most of it. Bangladesh is the fourth largest producer of rice with 75 per cent of its arable land used for paddy cultivation. Suffice to say that rice—not just its consumption, but also its production—defines the Bengali culture more than we realise ourselves.\n\nIn this tropical land, summers are harsh. Farmers, labourers, artisans, who go out to work in the the fields carry with them a tiffin box of rice soaked in water, some salt, some green chillies, and a wedge of onion. This rice ferments to form _panta bhaat_. Sometimes, water is added to the cooked rice at night and had for breakfast. _Panta bhaat_ originated as, and still is, means of sustenance for the poor. Different parts of eastern India have different names for this recipe—in Orissa they call it _pakhala_, and in Assam _poita bhaat_.\n\nThe fermentation of the rice carbohydrates by good bacteria increases the availability of a lot of micronutrients and minerals in the rice. The table below shows a comparison of available nutrition of 100 grams of cooked rice and _panta bhaat_:\n\n| Minerals  | Cooked Rice | Panta Bhaat |  \n|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n| Iron      | 3.4 mg      | 73.91 mg    |\n| Sodium    | 475 mg      | 303 mg      |\n| Potassium | 21 mg       | 839 mg      |\nSource: {% link \"The Telegraph, 4 August 2011\" https://www.telegraphindia.com/1110804/jsp/northeast/story_14328967.jsp %}\n\nConsumed in summer, _panta bhaat_ supplies probiotic bacteria and plenty of micronutrients that aid digestion. It produces a soporific effect that is conducive to a siesta that Bengalis love.\n\nIn spite of its humble origin, _panta bhaat_ is loved and enjoyed by many people, rich and poor. There is no real recipe for _panta bhaat_. So, these are our serving suggestions based on what our family commonly eats with _panta_.\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 13 hours\n**YIELDS** 4 servings (75g rice per person)\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n- 300g Rice (small-grained, unperfumed, and parboiled)\n- Potatoes (halved)\n- Lime or _gondhoraj lebu_\n- Green chillies\n- Sliced onions\n- _Kasundi_ (Bengali mustard)\n- Salt\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1. The first step in this recipe is boiling the rice. Wash the rice thoroughly and fill your pot with water. As usual, we need at least five times as much water as the rice. For details, check out our video on [how to cook the perfect rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/).\n2. In the same pot as the rice, add some peeled and halved potatoes. This is so the potatoes are boiled at the same time as the rice.\n3. Set the pot on the stove and boil the rice for 10 minutes longer than you normally would—for this recipe, we need the rice to be soft and mushy.\n4. Extract the boiled potatoes from the pot. Strain the rice and set it aside to cool completely.\n5. Once the rice is cool, add regular water to the pot. The water level should be about 2 cm over the level of rice.\n6. Using your hands, gently break up the lumps in the rice.\n7. Cover and place the pot in a cool, dark place for 12 hours. This will give the rice a chance to ferment and develop good bacteria.\n8. While eating, take fistsful of rice from the pot and squeeze as much water out of it as possible. Transfer to a serving bowl.\n9. Using your hands, mash the rice thoroughly. Also mash in half a boiled potato along with it.\n10. Add some freshly squeezed lime juice, crushed green chillies, salt, and _kasundi_ to the rice. Mix to combine.\n11.

In a momo, since all the ingredients are steamed at the same time, cutting the vegetables finely ensures that they all cook together. Besides, you don’t want a large chunk of, say, onion in your momo, rather a little bit of everything in each bite. This step is the most important, so take you time with the chopping.","If using pork fat, hack it to a mince using your knife. If using butter, melt it in a microwave or over the stove.","To a mixing bowl, transfer the minced pork, chopped vegetables, and the fat/butter. To these, add the salt, pepper, MSG, and soy sauce.","Mix thoroughly until everything is well combined. Cover and set it in the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours, although it is best if you can do this overnight. This standing time will allow all the flavours to mingle together. Moreover, chilling the pork mix makes the job of filling the momos infinitely easier.","Now make the momo wrappers as shown in this video.","Divide the pork mix into 20 g portions. Place these back in the fridge to chill until you need them. We like to portion our filling on two separate plates, so that one can stay in the fridge until the one you’re currently using gets warm, in which case you can just switch out the plates. That way, you always have a batch of chilled pork.","Take a momo wrapper and place the pork mix at its centre. Apply water all around the edges of the wrapper and start pleating. Use your left hand to form the pleats and keep the filling inside, and right hand to pinch the pleats closed. If you’re just starting out, try resting the momos on the table for easier shaping. Beginners may also use a little less filling to practice with. For a demonstration, watch this video. Make sure that the momos are perfectly sealed and that there are no air pockets within. These might cause the momos to burst while steaming.","Grease the steaming dish with oil and arrange the momos on it. Don’t crowd the steamer. Place it over boiling water and steam for around 12 minutes (±2 minutes). You don’t want to overcook the momos, or they’ll become dry and chewy.","Transfer to a plate immediately and serve with hot soup and chutney."]},"_content":"\n\n<p class=\"post-byline\">Juicy, flavourful pork dumplings!</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Calcutta has embraced the momo with an unconditional love Bengalis reserve only for good food.</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n[_In this series, we tip our hats to some of our favourite dishes available in the restaurants, cafés, and cabins of Calcutta.

The pork shoulder and pork belly are good cuts for using in momos.\n\nServe it with a simple hot momo chutney and a bowl of momo soup.\n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 5 hours (including 3 hours of wait time)\n**YIELDS** 48 momos (6 servings)\n**calories** 76 kcal per momo\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                     | \n|----------|--------------------------------|\n|    540 g | Fatty minced pork (30–50% fat) |\n|    135 g | Onions                         |\n|    135 g | Green onions                   |\n|     25 g | Ginger                         |\n|     25 g | Green chillies                 |\n|     30 g | Coriander leaves               |\n|     30 g | Pork fat / butter              |\n|     10 g | Salt                           |\n|    1 tsp | Pepper                         |\n|    ½ tsp | MSG                            |\n|     40 g | Soy sauce                      |\n|   48 pcs | Momo wrappers                  |\n|    2 tsp | Oil (for greasing)             |\n\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Steamer\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1. Finely chop the onions, green onions, coriander, ginger, and green chillies. In a momo, since all the ingredients are steamed at the same time, cutting the vegetables finely ensures that they all cook together. Besides, you don’t want a large chunk of, say, onion in your momo, rather a little bit of everything in each bite. This step is the most important, so take you time with the chopping.\n2. If using pork fat, hack it to a mince using your knife. If using butter, melt it in a microwave or over the stove.\n3. To a mixing bowl, transfer the minced pork, chopped vegetables, and the fat/butter. To these, add the salt, pepper, MSG, and soy sauce.\n4. Mix thoroughly until everything is well combined. Cover and set it in the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours, although it is best if you can do this overnight. This standing time will allow all the flavours to mingle together. Moreover, chilling the pork mix makes the job of filling the momos infinitely easier.\n5. Now make the momo wrappers as shown in this video.\n6. Divide the pork mix into 20 g portions. Place these back in the fridge to chill until you need them. We like to portion our filling on two separate plates, so that one can stay in the fridge until the one you’re currently using gets warm, in which case you can just switch out the plates. That way, you always have a batch of chilled pork.\n7. Take a momo wrapper and place the pork mix at its centre. Apply water all around the edges of the wrapper and start pleating. Use your left hand to form the pleats and keep the filling inside, and right hand to pinch the pleats closed. If you’re just starting out, try resting the momos on the table for easier shaping. Beginners may also use a little less filling to practice with. For a demonstration, watch this video. Make sure that the momos are perfectly sealed and that there are no air pockets within. These might cause the momos to burst while steaming.\n8. Grease the steaming dish with oil and arrange the momos on it. Don’t crowd the steamer. Place it over boiling water and steam for around 12 minutes (±2 minutes). You don’t want to overcook the momos, or they’ll become dry and chewy. \n9. Transfer to a plate immediately and serve with hot [soup](/recipe/momo-soup/) and [chutney](/recipe/red-momo-chutney). \n\n\n## Served with\n- [Momo soup](/recipe/momo-soup/)\n- [Momo chutney](/recipe/red-momo-chutney)","source":"_posts/pork-momo.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Pork Momos\ntags:\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - momo\n  - pork\n  - Calcutta-style food\n  - snack\ndescription: >-\n  Soft and juicy steamed pork dumplings, momos are a staple in Darjeeling,\n  Sikkim, Nepal and Bhutan.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/q_auto:good/v1511469018/-pork-momos-website-thumbnail-1_edefeb.png\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: hVRRaYjjUis\ndate: 2017-11-16 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Pork Momo\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1511469018/-pork-momos-website-thumbnail-1_edefeb.png\",\"description\":\"Juicy, flavourful pork dumplings from Darjeeling, Nepal, Sikkim, and Bhutan\",\"prepTime\":\"PT2H\",\"totalTime\":\"PT5H\",\"recipeYield\":\"48\",\"nutrition\":{\"@type\":\"NutritionInformation\",\"servingSize\":\"48 momos\",\"calories\":\"76 calories\"}, \"recipeIngredient\":[\"540 g Fatty minced pork (30–50% fat)\",\"135 g Onions\",\"135 g Green onions\",\"25 g Ginger\",\"25 g Green chillies\",\"30 g Coriander leaves\",\"30 g Pork fat / butter\",\"10 g Salt\",\"1 tsp Pepper\",\"½ tsp MSG\",\"40 g Soy sauce\",\"48 pcs Momo wrappers\",\"2 tsp Oil (for greasing)\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"Finely chop the onions, green onions, coriander, ginger, and green chillies.

For the batter, add the rice grains to an electric grinder and blitz them to a fine powder. You now have rice flour.","2. In a mixing bowl, add the _maida_ (75 g), _sooji_ (30 g), rice flour (10 g), sugar (30 g), salt (¼ tsp), and milk (280 g).","3. Mix the ingredients together till they are more or less combined. Do not over-mix or your crêpes may turn out chewy.","4. Cover the batter and set it aside to rest, for 2 hours. This will allow time for the _sooji_ to swell up and the sugar to melt.","5. While your batter is resting, use this time to prepare the _kheer_, which will form the filling for our _patishapta_.","6. For the kheer, take 1.5 kg milk in a heavy-bottom saucepan and set it to boil.","7. Once bubbling, stir in 65 g sugar.","8. Keep boiling the milk, while stirring it continuously, for about 90 minutes.","9. During this entire time, the pot should be on medium to low heat.","10. At regular intervals of 3–4 minutes, be sure to scrape the fat from the bottom and sides of the pot, and incorporate it into the boiling milk. This step, as well as the previous one, is crucial.

Once the milk has thickened such that when you lift some of it on your spoon and drop it, it falls in clumps, make a paste of 1 tsp flour and 1 tbsp milk.","12. Add this paste to the pot.

Give your batter a quick stir till it is uniform.","16. Now, set a non-stick pan on medium-low flame and allow it to heat up completely.","17.

Add the rice grains to an electric grinder and blitz them to a fine powder. You now have rice flour.\n2. In a mixing bowl, add the _maida_ (75 g), _sooji_ (30 g), rice flour (10 g), sugar (30 g), salt (¼ tsp), and milk (280 g).\n3. Mix the ingredients together till they are more or less combined. Do not over-mix or your crêpes may turn out chewy.\n4. Cover the batter and set it aside to rest, for 2 hours. This will allow time for the _sooji_ to swell up and the sugar to melt.\n5. While your batter is resting, prepare the _kheer_, which will form the filling for our _patishapta_.\n\n**STEP II—MAKE THE _KHEER_ [[WATCH HOW TO MAKE _KHEER_]](https://youtu.be/PzFXjD8D3AY?list=PLGX3dcCcJDYweaL6mlxJ54UAoKZAjNluz)**\n1. Take 1.5 kg milk in a heavy-bottom saucepan and set it to boil.\n2. Once bubbling, stir in 65 g sugar.\n3. Keep boiling the milk, while stirring it continuously, for about 90 minutes.\n4. During this entire time, the pot should be on medium to low heat.\n5. At regular intervals of 3–4 minutes, be sure to scrape the solids from the bottom and sides of the pot, and incorporate them into the boiling milk. This step, as well as the previous one, is crucial. We don’t want our _kheer_ to burn at any point.\n6. Once the milk has thickened such that when you lift some of it on your spoon and drop it, it falls in clumps, make a paste of 1 tsp flour and 1 tbsp milk.\n7. Add this paste to the pot. Stir and cook for another 5 minutes.\n8. Allow the _kheer_ to cool before proceeding to the next stage.\n\n**STEP III—MAKE THE _PATISHAPTA_**\n1. Divide the _kheer_ in equal portions of 22 g each.\n2. Give your batter a quick stir till it is uniform.\n3. Now, set a non-stick pan on medium-low flame and allow it to heat up completely.\n4. Once the pan is hot, smear it with a very, _very_ light coating of _ghee_ (remember, we are already using a non-stick pan).\n5. Using a ladle, take about 25 g of the batter and drop it in the centre of the pan.\n6. Swirl it around gradually to form a thin crêpe, about 12 cm in diameter.\n7. Roll a portion of the _kheer_ between your palms to form a log (about 8 cm long), and flatten it with your fingers.\n8. Place it at one end of the crêpe and start folding the crêpe into a roll, with the help of a spatula. [Note that we are cooking only one side of the crêpe.]\n9. Transfer the _patishapta_ from the pan to a plate and proceed making the rest. These can be eaten hot, or they can be cooled and stored in the refrigerator for up to 7 days.\n","source":"_posts/patishapta-with-kheer-filling.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Patishapta (with kheer filling)\ndescription: This Bengali sweet recipe is a type of \"pithe\".

For this recipe, the cauliflower must be cut into chunky florets (about 5 cm large). Remember that the flavour is contained in the stem, so try to retain as much of it as possible. The florets are cooked twice—first stir-fried over medium heat to release some of their flavour, and then again with the spices and gravy. Even after all the frying and boiling, each cauliflower floret should hold its shape.

It should snap when you run a knife through its stalk, and not disintegrate at touch from over-boiling.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong>  40 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 4 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl</th>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>OIL</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>30 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil (for frying)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil (for cooking)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong><em>PHORON</em> (TEMPERING)</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2 pieces</td>\n<td>Dried red chillies (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2 pieces</td>\n<td>Bay leaves (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3 pieces</td>\n<td>Cardamom (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>3 pieces</td>\n<td>Cloves (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>1 piece</td>\n<td>Cinnamon (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>1 g (or ¼ tsp)</td>\n<td>Cumin seeds (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>VEGETABLES</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>500 g</td>\n<td>Cauliflower (cut in large florets)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>250 g</td>\n<td>Potatoes (diced; 5 cm cubes)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>50 g</td>\n<td>Peas (shelled)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>50 g</td>\n<td>Tomatoes (diced)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>SPICES AND SEASONING</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>30 g</td>\n<td>Ginger paste</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Cumin powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>1 g</td>\n<td>Coriander powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Turmeric powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>1 g</td>\n<td>Red chilli powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>16 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>28 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>GARNISH</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>7 g</td>\n<td>Ghee</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n<td>Garam masala powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22</td>\n<td>2 g (or 2 pieces)</td>\n<td>Green chillies (slit)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | wok | frying pan | cooking pot</li>\n<li>Lid for cooking vessel</li>\n<li><em>Khunti</em> | long spatula</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n<li>Electric kettle (optional)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><p><strong>PART I—FRYING THE CAULIFLOWER</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cut the cauliflower in large florets, about 5 cm large.</li>\n<li>Heat 30 g mustard oil in the pan.</li>\n<li>Stir-fry the cauliflower for 5–7 minutes on medium-high heat till they develop a light amber colour.</li>\n<li><p>Remove the cauliflower from the pan and reserve for later use.</p>\n<p><strong>PART II—TEMPERING THE OIL</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>Now, heat 10 g mustard oil in the same pan.</li>\n<li>Add all the <em>phoron</em> (dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds) into the oil.</li>\n<li>Once the whole spices start crackling, add the cubed potatoes.</li>\n<li><p>Fry the potatoes for 5 minutes on low heat.</p>\n<p><strong>PART III—SAUTEEING THE SPICES</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>In a small bowl, make a spice paste by adding 100 g of water to ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and red chilli powder.</li>\n<li>Add this mixture to the pan and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.</li>\n<li>Add the salt, sugar, and another 100 g of water, and cook till the water dries off again.</li>\n<li>Add the diced tomatoes and a slit green chilli.</li>\n<li>Once the tomatoes have assimilated into the spice mix, add in the peas and fried cauliflower.</li>\n<li><p>Cook the vegetables on low heat, with the lid on, for 3 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>PART IV—PREPARING THE GRAVY</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>Add 400 g hot water to the pan.</li>\n<li>Cook the potatoes and cauliflower with the lid on for 10 minutes till the cauliflower stalks are tender.

Smear the cut and cleaned _padba machh_ with ¾ tsp turmeric powder, ¾ tsp salt, and 1 tsp mustard oil. Mix till the fish are well coated, and set aside.\n2. Cut the brinjal into 5-cm segments. We need as many pieces of brinjal as there are fish—in this case, five.\n3. Roughly chop the tomatoes.\n4. Slit the green chillies.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE _BORI_, BRINJAL, AND FISH**\n1. Heat your _kadai_ well and add 35 g mustard oil to the pan.\n2. Once the oil is completely hot (that is, once it has begun to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow), add the _dal’er bori_.\n3. Fry the _boris_ for about 20 seconds till they are golden brown. They colour very quickly, so be alert while frying them.\n4. Remove the _boris_ from the oil and set aside.\n5. Next, add the brinjal pieces to the oil.\n6. Stir-fry for about 4 minutes till they are golden. Remove them from the oil and set aside.\n7. Now, in batches, fry the marinated fish. Fresh, sweetwater fish such as the _pabda_ do not need heavy searing. Fry them lightly to preserve their delicate flavour. A minute on each side should do the job.\n8. Remove the fried fish on a plate and reserve for later use.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING THE _JHOL_**\n1. Before we start, make a paste with 15 g salt, 6 g turmeric powder, and 50 g water. Mix and keep ready.\n2. Heat 7 g mustard oil in the _kadai_. (If the oil that you fried the fish in is not burnt, you may use the same oil to prepare the _jhol_.)\n3. Add the _kaalo jeere_, tomatoes, and 3 green chillies to the oil.\n4. Fry them for a minute on medium heat.\n5. Add the turmeric and salt mixture to the pan, and fry till the water in the spice mix dries up.\n6. Now, pour 400 g of hot water (either heated in an electric kettle or on the stove) into the pan. This will form the curry.\n7. Once the curry starts to simmer, add in the fried _boris_.\n8. Simmer for another 2 minutes before lowering in the _pabda machh_, one by one. Also add the fish drippings that might have collected on the plate that held the fried fish; they are delicious.\n9. Add the fried brinjal to the curry.\n10. Let everything bubble for about 5 minutes. As the curry boils, you will notice that the colour of the _jhol_ has changed from deep yellow to bright yellow. That’s when you know that the turmeric is cooked, and that the curry won’t taste of the raw spice.\n11. Now, pick one of the softened green chillies from the curry onto a small bowl. Add ½ tsp _atta_ to it, along with 1 tbsp of water. Mash the three together, until paste-like.\n12. Add this mixture to the _jhol_. The mashed green chilli will release the heat, while the flour will help the curry thicken and develop body.\n13. Garnish with 2 more slit green chillies, a drizzle of mustard oil (about 7 g), and chopped coriander.\n14.

Smear the cut and cleaned _padba machh_ with ¾ tsp turmeric powder, ¾ tsp salt, and 1 tsp mustard oil. Mix till the fish are well coated, and set aside.\n2. Cut the brinjal into 5-cm segments. We need as many pieces of brinjal as there are fish—in this case, five.\n3. Roughly chop the tomatoes.\n4. Slit the green chillies.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE _BORI_, BRINJAL, AND FISH**\n1. Heat your _kadai_ well and add 35 g mustard oil to the pan.\n2. Once the oil is completely hot (that is, once it has begun to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow), add the _dal’er bori_.\n3. Fry the _boris_ for about 20 seconds till they are golden brown. They colour very quickly, so be alert while frying them.\n4. Remove the _boris_ from the oil and set aside.\n5. Next, add the brinjal pieces to the oil.\n6. Stir-fry for about 4 minutes till they are golden. Remove them from the oil and set aside.\n7. Now, in batches, fry the marinated fish. Fresh, sweetwater fish such as the _pabda_ do not need heavy searing. Fry them lightly to preserve their delicate flavour. A minute on each side should do the job.\n8. Remove the fried fish on a plate and reserve for later use.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING THE _JHOL_**\n1. Before we start, make a paste with 15 g salt, 6 g turmeric powder, and 50 g water. Mix and keep ready.\n2. Heat 7 g mustard oil in the _kadai_. (If the oil that you fried the fish in is not burnt, you may use the same oil to prepare the _jhol_.)\n3. Add the _kaalo jeere_, tomatoes, and 3 green chillies to the oil.\n4. Fry them for a minute on medium heat.\n5. Add the turmeric and salt mixture to the pan, and fry till the water in the spice mix dries up.\n6. Now, pour 400 g of hot water (either heated in an electric kettle or on the stove) into the pan. This will form the curry.\n7. Once the curry starts to simmer, add in the fried _boris_.\n8. Simmer for another 2 minutes before lowering in the _pabda machh_, one by one. Also add the fish drippings that might have collected on the plate that held the fried fish; they are delicious.\n9. Add the fried brinjal to the curry.\n10. Let everything bubble for about 5 minutes. As the curry boils, you will notice that the colour of the _jhol_ has changed from deep yellow to bright yellow. That’s when you know that the turmeric is cooked, and that the curry won’t taste of the raw spice.\n11. Now, pick one of the softened green chillies from the curry onto a small bowl. Add ½ tsp _atta_ to it, along with 1 tbsp of water. Mash the three together, until paste-like.\n12. Add this mixture to the _jhol_. The mashed green chilli will release the heat, while the flour will help the curry thicken and develop body.\n13. Garnish with 2 more slit green chillies, a drizzle of mustard oil (about 7 g), and chopped coriander.\n14. Allow everything to bubble for a couple of more minutes, before turning off the heat.\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n","slug":"pabda-machher-tel-jhol","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-30T02:29:28.346Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjancyb2r004incvh1mjoj1tr","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A flavourful, light curry with <em>pabda</em> fish</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">It is unbelievable that something with a handful of ingredients can taste so divine.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">T</span>he <em>pabda machh</em> is one of the most beloved of Bengal’s fishes.

While producing good _kababs_ generally requires special grilling, charring or _tandoori_ techniques, _shami kabab_ can be easily prepared at home with no special equipment. Popular on the Indian subcontinent, this snack resembles a pan-fried, ground-meat patty. It is best made with a lean, boneless red meat of your choice (mutton, beef, lamb, etc.). It is important that the meat has a low fat but high muscle content. Fat within the meat tends to melt the kabab when it is fried, while we want it to hold itself together. More muscle and fibre, on the other hand, will ensure that the meat has some texture when it is ground, providing a satisfying resistance with each bite. The use of _chhola’r dal_ (split Bengal gram) adds nuttiness. Besides that, the other flavours come from chopped mint leaves, green chillies, _garam masala_, and ghee. We use a beaten egg to bind everything together. Depending on the recipe, such kababs may sometimes be coated in eggs or bread crumbs before they are fried. We, however, fry them directly so that the meat itself forms a rich, brown, caramelised crust.  \n\n\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 2 hours   \n**YIELDS** 16–17 kababs\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n\n| Quantity | Ingredient                            | \n|----------|---------------------------------------|\n|     1 kg | Boneless mutton or beef (lean)        |\n|    200 g | Chhola’r dal (split Bengal gram)      |\n|    100 g | Onions                                |\n|     30 g | Ginger                                |\n|     20 g | Garlic                                |\n|    4 pcs | Bay leaves                            |\n|    8 pcs | Dried red chillies                    |\n|     16 g | Green chillies                        |\n|     10 g | Mint leaves                           |\n|     30 g | Raisins                               |\n|     10 g | Lime juice                            |\n|      4 g | [Shahi garam masala](recipe/shahi-garam-masala/)                    |\n|      5 g | Ghee                                  |\n|        1 | Beaten egg                            |\n|       20 | Salt                                  |\n|  ~ 200 g | Vegetable oil (1-cm deep, for frying) |\n\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot\n- Flat frying pan | skillet\n-  _Jhhajhhri_ | perforated frying spoon\n- _Jhuri_ | draining rack | colander \n\n\n## Method\n\n1.

Cooling foods slowly start getting incorporated into the diet to combat the rising temperatures.

One byproduct of this storm is that it causes a lot of mangoes to prematurely fall off trees.

The distinguishing feature of this steamed dumpling is its layered appearance. Once properly proofed and steamed, all the layers of the bun seem to open up like a flower. In this recipe, we show you how to knead, roll, and shape the dough in order to get a perfect tingmo. </p>\n<p><hr><br><strong>A note on the yeast:</strong> Yeast will need to be used depending on its type. Check the box/packaging to determine whether yours is an ‘instant’ yeast, ‘active dry’ yeast, or ‘fresh’ yeast. <strong>Instant yeast</strong> doesn’t need to be separately activated. It can be mixed directly into the flour and kneaded along with the other ingredients. <strong>Active dry yeast</strong> and <strong>fresh yeast</strong> need to be activated before they can be added to the flour. To do that, disperse the yeast in lukewarm water (in this case, about 145 g) along with the sugar (10 g). Cover and set aside for about 15 minutes, at the end of which, if your yeast is active, the mixture should take on a frothy appearance. Add this mixture to the flour and proceed as instructed. </p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 2 hours<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 4 tingmos</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>250 g</td>\n<td>Maida (flour)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 g</td>\n<td>Dry instant yeast</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>145 g</td>\n<td>Warm water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 tbsp</td>\n<td>Vegetable oil (for greasing)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Mixing bowl</li>\n<li>Rolling pin</li>\n<li>Steamer</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, sugar, yeast, and water.
