Add atta, salt, sugar, and oil to a mixing bowl. Mix to distribute the oil evenly among the other ingredients.","2. Add the water. Use hot water for soft porotas.","3. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes. It may seem tacky at the outset, but keep going. The dough should be soft and pliable so that it can hold a generous amount of filling.","4. Once the kneading is done, cover and rest the dough for about 30 minutes.","5. Meanwhile, halve or quarter your potatoes (depending on their size) and steam them till they are tender. This should take about 20 minutes. Steaming ensures that the potatoes do not overcook or absorb any excess moisture from sitting in a pot of boiling water. The drier the filling, the easier it is to stuff the porota without any leakage.","6. Peel the potatoes and mash them while they are still hot to allow all the steam to escape. This will further ensure that the filling remains dry.","7. Finely chop the onions, ginger, garlic, and green chillies. Tear or roughly chop the curry or coriander leaves, whichever you are using.","8. Heat 7 g vegetable oil in a skillet. Add the onions and fry them for about 4 to 5 minutes till they turn brown.","9. Add the ginger and green chillies, and fry for another minute or so before adding the garlic and curry leaves/kasuri methi/coriander leaves. Do not cook the garlic too much; turn off the heat 30 seconds after adding it to the pan.","10. Transfer this mixture from the pan on to the mashed potatoes. Also add the salt, chaat masala, bhaja masala, and jowan.","11. Give everything a good mix until the filling is uniform.","12. Divide the filling into four equal parts (each should weigh about 75 g). Give the dough a quick knead and divide it into four equal portions too (about 70 g each). Form each portion of the filling and dough into a neat ball and keep at the ready.","13. Using your hands, flatten a ball of dough until it has stretched to a diameter of 8 cm. Place a ball of the filling in the centre.","14. Bring the sides of the dough towards one another. The idea is to completely enclose the filling with the dough. Pinch the gathered sides to seal the package.","15. Coat the dough with some flour and place it on the workstation in front of you. Press down gently to flatten the dough and distribute the filling evenly within it.","16. Using a rolling pin, start rolling in two short, gentle strokes. Rotate 90 degrees between each set of strokes. Keep doing this until the porota is about 18 cm in diameter. Be sure to roll at the edges and not at the centre. This will ensure that the porota is of a uniform thickness throughout.","17. In a skillet set on medium heat, add 1 tbsp of oil. Once hot, lay the porota flat on it. Wait for a minute and apply 1 tsp of oil to the top. Flip the porota.","18. Keep flipping every minute until the porota is an even, golden colour on both sides.","19. Remove from the skillet and serve hot."]},"_content":"\n\n\n<p class=\"post-byline\">A pan-fried flatbread stuffed with a filling of mashed potatoes</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">In this recipe, we take you through the process of mixing, stuffing, rolling, and frying the perfect ‘parathas’.</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">A</span>lu porota or ‘alu paratha’ is wildly popular all over South Asia—no _dhaba_ scene is complete without the sight of hot parathas with melting butter on top. Home kitchens have undoubtedly devised healthier ways of dishing out this family favourite. Not only are these _porotas_ satisfyingly delicious when served piping hot right off the skillet, they also make for extraordinarily good packed meals. Ideal for school or work tiffin boxes or long train journeys, soft _alu porotas_ need few accompaniments besides some chilled yoghurt and hot, tangy _achar_.\n\nA good stuffed _porota_ has a flaky exterior (you should be able to tear it with one hand) and a generous amount of well-spiced filling. Moreover, the filling should be evenly distributed within the _porota_ so you get some with every bite. In this recipe, we take you step-by-step through the process of creating soft, well-balanced _porotas_.\n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 45 minutes\n**YIELDS** 4 parathas\n**CALORIES** 385 kcal per paratha\n***\n## Ingredients\n|            Quantity | Ingredient                                     |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n|   **FOR THE DOUGH** |                                                |\n|               150 g | Atta (whole wheat flour)                       |\n|                 3 g | Salt                                           |\n|                 7 g | Sugar                                          |\n|                 8 g | Oil                                            |\n|           100–110 g | Hot water                                      |\n| **FOR THE FILLING** |                                                |\n|               250 g | Potatoes (boiled and peeled)                   |\n|                80 g | Onions (finely chopped)                        |\n|                15 g | Ginger (minced)                                |\n|                10 g | Garlic (minced)                                |\n|                 5 g | Green chillies (chopped)                       |\n|                 5 g | Kasuri methi/curry leaves/coriander leaves     |\n|                 5 g | Salt                                           |\n|               ½ tsp | Chaat masala                                   |\n|               1 tsp | Bhaja masala                                   |\n|               ¼ tsp | Jowan (carom seeds)                            |\n|               100 g | Oil for cooking/frying                         |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Steamer | boiling pot\n- Rolling pin\n- Skillet | _tawa_\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n- Napkin | paper towel (optional)\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Steamer\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—MIX THE DOUGH**\n1. Add _atta_, salt, sugar, and oil to a mixing bowl. Mix to distribute the oil evenly among the other ingredients.\n2. Add the water. Use hot water for soft _porotas_.\n3. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes. It may seem tacky at the outset, but keep going. The dough should be soft and pliable so that it can hold a generous amount of filling.\n4. Once the kneading is done, cover and rest the dough for about 30 minutes.   \n\n**STEP II—PREPARE THE FILLING**\n1. Meanwhile, halve or quarter your potatoes (depending on their size) and steam them till they are tender. This should take about 20 minutes. Steaming ensures that the potatoes do not overcook or absorb any excess moisture from sitting in a pot of boiling water. The drier the filling, the easier it is to stuff the _porota_ without any leakage.\n2. Peel the potatoes and mash them while they are still hot to allow all the steam to escape. This will further ensure that the filling remains dry.\n3. Finely chop the onions, ginger, garlic, and green chillies. Tear or roughly chop the curry or coriander leaves, whichever you are using.\n4. Heat 7 g vegetable oil in a skillet. Add the onions and fry them for about 4 to 5 minutes till they turn brown. \n5. Add the ginger and green chillies, and fry for another minute or so before adding the garlic and curry leaves/_kasuri methi_/coriander leaves. Do not cook the garlic too much; turn off the heat 30 seconds after adding it to the pan.\n6. Transfer this mixture from the pan on to the mashed potatoes. Also add the salt, _chaat masala_, _bhaja masala_, and _jowan_.\n7. Give everything a good mix until the filling is uniform. \n\n**STEP III—STUFF, ROLL, FRY**\n1. Divide the filling into four equal parts (each should weigh about 75 g). Give the dough a quick knead and divide it into four equal portions too (about 70 g each). Form each portion of the filling and dough into a neat ball and keep at the ready.\n2. Using your hands, flatten a ball of dough until it has stretched to a diameter of 8 cm. Place a ball of the filling in the centre. \n3. Bring the sides of the dough towards one another. The idea is to completely enclose the filling with the dough. Pinch the gathered sides to seal the package.\n4. Coat the dough with some flour and place it on the workstation in front of you. Press down gently to flatten the dough and distribute the filling evenly within it.\n5. Using a rolling pin, start rolling in two short, gentle strokes. Rotate 90 degrees between each set of strokes. Keep doing this until the _porota_ is about 18 cm in diameter. Be sure to roll at the edges and not at the centre. This will ensure that the _porota_ is of a uniform thickness throughout. \n6. In a skillet set on medium heat, add 1 tbsp of oil. Once hot, lay the _porota_ flat on it. Wait for a minute and apply 1 tsp of oil to the top. Flip the _porota_.\n7. Keep flipping every minute until the _porota_ is an even, golden colour on both sides. \n8. Remove from the skillet and serve hot.\n\n\n\n## Served with\n- Yoghurt\n- Pickles\n- Green chilli\n- Raw onion","source":"_posts/aloo-paratha.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Aloo Paratha\ntags:\n  - snack\n  - vegetarian\n  - vegan\n  - paratha\ndescription: >-\n  Alu porota or ‘paratha’ needs no introduction.

Ideal for school or work tiffin boxes or long train journeys, soft <em>alu porotas</em> need few accompaniments besides some chilled yoghurt and hot, tangy <em>achar</em>.</p>\n<p>A good stuffed <em>porota</em> has a flaky exterior (you should be able to tear it with one hand) and a generous amount of well-spiced filling. Moreover, the filling should be evenly distributed within the <em>porota</em> so you get some with every bite. In this recipe, we take you step-by-step through the process of creating soft, well-balanced <em>porotas</em>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 45 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 4 parathas<br><strong>CALORIES</strong> 385 kcal per paratha</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR THE DOUGH</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>150 g</td>\n<td>Atta (whole wheat flour)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8 g</td>\n<td>Oil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100–110 g</td>\n<td>Hot water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR THE FILLING</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>250 g</td>\n<td>Potatoes (boiled and peeled)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>80 g</td>\n<td>Onions (finely chopped)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Ginger (minced)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Garlic (minced)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Green chillies (chopped)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Kasuri methi/curry leaves/coriander leaves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n<td>Chaat masala</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 tsp</td>\n<td>Bhaja masala</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Jowan (carom seeds)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g</td>\n<td>Oil for cooking/frying</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Mixing bowl</li>\n<li>Steamer | boiling pot</li>\n<li>Rolling pin</li>\n<li>Skillet | <em>tawa</em></li>\n<li><em>Khunti</em> | long spatula</li>\n<li>Napkin | paper towel (optional)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n<li>Steamer</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><p><strong>STEP I—MIX THE DOUGH</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add <em>atta</em>, salt, sugar, and oil to a mixing bowl. Mix to distribute the oil evenly among the other ingredients.</li>\n<li>Add the water. Use hot water for soft <em>porotas</em>.</li>\n<li>Knead the dough for about 5 minutes. It may seem tacky at the outset, but keep going. The dough should be soft and pliable so that it can hold a generous amount of filling.</li>\n<li>Once the kneading is done, cover and rest the dough for about 30 minutes.   </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>STEP II—PREPARE THE FILLING</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Meanwhile, halve or quarter your potatoes (depending on their size) and steam them till they are tender. This should take about 20 minutes. Steaming ensures that the potatoes do not overcook or absorb any excess moisture from sitting in a pot of boiling water. The drier the filling, the easier it is to stuff the <em>porota</em> without any leakage.</li>\n<li>Peel the potatoes and mash them while they are still hot to allow all the steam to escape. This will further ensure that the filling remains dry.</li>\n<li>Finely chop the onions, ginger, garlic, and green chillies. Tear or roughly chop the curry or coriander leaves, whichever you are using.</li>\n<li>Heat 7 g vegetable oil in a skillet. Add the onions and fry them for about 4 to 5 minutes till they turn brown. </li>\n<li>Add the ginger and green chillies, and fry for another minute or so before adding the garlic and curry leaves/<em>kasuri methi</em>/coriander leaves. Do not cook the garlic too much; turn off the heat 30 seconds after adding it to the pan.</li>\n<li>Transfer this mixture from the pan on to the mashed potatoes. Also add the salt, <em>chaat masala</em>, <em>bhaja masala</em>, and <em>jowan</em>.</li>\n<li>Give everything a good mix until the filling is uniform. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>STEP III—STUFF, ROLL, FRY</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Divide the filling into four equal parts (each should weigh about 75 g). Give the dough a quick knead and divide it into four equal portions too (about 70 g each). Form each portion of the filling and dough into a neat ball and keep at the ready.</li>\n<li>Using your hands, flatten a ball of dough until it has stretched to a diameter of 8 cm. Place a ball of the filling in the centre. </li>\n<li>Bring the sides of the dough towards one another. The idea is to completely enclose the filling with the dough. Pinch the gathered sides to seal the package.</li>\n<li>Coat the dough with some flour and place it on the workstation in front of you. Press down gently to flatten the dough and distribute the filling evenly within it.</li>\n<li>Using a rolling pin, start rolling in two short, gentle strokes. Rotate 90 degrees between each set of strokes. Keep doing this until the <em>porota</em> is about 18 cm in diameter. Be sure to roll at the edges and not at the centre. This will ensure that the <em>porota</em> is of a uniform thickness throughout. </li>\n<li>In a skillet set on medium heat, add 1 tbsp of oil. Once hot, lay the <em>porota</em> flat on it. Wait for a minute and apply 1 tsp of oil to the top. Flip the <em>porota</em>.</li>\n<li>Keep flipping every minute until the <em>porota</em> is an even, golden colour on both sides. </li>\n<li>Remove from the skillet and serve hot.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Served-with\"><a href=\"#Served-with\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Served with\"></a>Served with</h2><ul>\n<li>Yoghurt</li>\n<li>Pickles</li>\n<li>Green chilli</li>\n<li>Raw onion</li>\n</ul>"},{"title":"Begun Bhaja | Spicy Fried Eggplant or Brinjal","description":"Begun Or baingan bhaja is a Bengali vegetarian recipe of shallow-fried eggplant disks.

There are five important points to remember while cooking this dish—(1) The cabbage must be cut as finely as possible. Larger strips will not only take longer to cook, they will fail to give the _badhakopi'r ghonto_ the desired texture; (2) Once you add the cabbage to the pan, don’t add any extra water; (3) Cook on low heat. This will ensure that the moisture extracted from the cabbage doesn't evaporate too quickly and cause the cabbage to stick to the pan; (4) Always cover the pan with a lid.

Take a segment, one at a time, and shave off shreds along its cross-section with your knife. Take your time with the cutting, because the outcome of the dish will depend on this step. [Watch this video, which shows you how to cut cabbage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3EUuW5S7s) for _badhakopi'r ghonto_.\n\n**PART II—TEMPERING THE OIL (_PHORON_)**\n2. Heat 15 g mustard oil in a pan till it begins to smoke.\n3. Add the _phoron_ (comprising the dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and cumin seeds) to the oil.\n4. Once the spices start crackling, add in the cubed potatoes.\n5. Fry the potatoes for 3 minutes on low heat, with the lid on.\n\n**PART III—SAUTEEING THE SPICES**\n6. Make a paste by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and 80 g of water.\n7. Add this mixture to the potatoes and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n8. Add in the diced tomatoes and shelled peas.\n9. Then, add another 80 g of water and sautee the spices till the water dries off.\n10. Add a slit green chilli and cook with the lid on for another minute.\n\n**PART IV—STEAMING THE CABBAGE**\n11. Add the shredded cabbage to the pan, along with the salt.\n12. Fold in the spices and cook on low heat with the lid on. The salt will start dehydrating the cabbage and drawing out its moisture.\n13. Steam the cabbage on low heat, with the lid on, for 12 minutes, stirring intermittently. Keep an eye on the pan to ensure that the cabbage doesn’t stick to the bottom.\n14. Add the sugar and cook for another 15 minutes, stirring intermittently. The sugar will soon start to caramelise. Be sure to scrape down and integrate the lightly browned bits of the _torkari_ that stick to the bottom of your pan (they are yummy!).\n15. This step is optional. You can coat a couple of cleaned prawns in a pinch of salt and turmeric powder, and fry in a separate pan for 30 seconds on each side. Chop the fried prawns in chunks of 1 cm, and add to the _ghonto_.\n16. Garnish with _ghee_, powdered _garam masala_, and a  slit green chilli.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | roti\n","source":"_posts/badhakopir-ghonto.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Badhakopi’r Ghonto | Dry Cabbage and Peas Curry\ndescription: A mildly spiced dry cabbage curry with peas-a kind of Bengali vegetarian ghonto with delicate flavours of ginger, garam masala and ghee.\ntags:\n  - ghonto\n  - torkari\n  - vegetarian\n  - vegan\n  - gluten-free\n  - cabbage\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1479339208/badhakopir-ghonto_thumbnail_c7ocub.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: nmkY-fGFTuY\ndate: 2016-12-01 20:30:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Badhakopi'r ghonto\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1479339208/badhakopir-ghonto_cover-small_uif59l.jpg\",\"description\":\"This is a beautifully spiced cabbage and peas preparation that is hot, sweet, and with hints of ginger, ghee, and garam masala.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT10M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT45M\",\"recipeYield\":\"4\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"Mustard oil (for cooking) 15 g\",\"Dried red chillies 1 piece\",\"Bay leaves 1 piece\",\"Cardamom 1 piece\",\"Cloves 1 piece\",\"Cinnamon 1 piece\",\"Cumin seeds 2 g (or ¼ tsp)\",\"Cabbage 400 g\",\"Potatoes 100 g\",\"Peas 50 g\",\"Tomatoes 30 g\",\"Prawns (optional) 75 g\",\"Ginger paste 20 g\",\"Cumin powder 2 g\",\"Coriander powder 1 g\",\"Turmeric powder 3 g\",\"Red chilli powder 1 g\",\"Salt 10 g\",\"Sugar 25 g\",\"Ghee 4 g\",\"Garam masala ¼ tsp\",\"Green chillies 2 g (or 2 pieces)\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1 Cut the cabbage into the thinnest possible shreds that you can manage.

Cover the bowl and rest the marinated chicken in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. For best results, leave it to marinate overnight.\n\n**STEP II—PREPARING THE CURRY**\n1. Peel and divide the potatoes into 4-cm halves or quarters. Put these in a microwave-safe bowl, add 2 tablespoons of water, cover the bowl with a cling film, and microwave for about 3 to 4 minutes. Alternatively, you can also parboil the potatoes in water on the stove.\n2. Cut the onions in thin slices. Thinly sliced onions (as opposed to roughly chopped or diced onions) give the curry the perfect texture.\n3. Heat 30 g mustard oil in a _kadai_. Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, temper it with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns.\n4. Add in the onions, along with the sugar, and fry them for about 8 to 10 minutes, till the onions are brown in colour. (We add the sugar at this stage to help the onions caramelize quickly.)\n5. Once the onions have caramelized, add 8 g turmeric powder and 18 g salt, along with 75 g of water.\n6. Fry the spices on medium heat till the water dries up. This should take about 5 minutes.\n7. Tip the marinated chicken into the _kadai_ (don’t forget to remove the lime peel from the bowl!), and mix it with the onions in the pan. Cook the chicken on medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will ensure that the smell of raw spices from the marinade is gone.\n8. Add in the parboiled potatoes and slit green chillies, and stir them in.\n8. Add 400 g of hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n9. Cover the pan and let the curry bubble for about 15 to 20 minutes, or till the chicken and potatoes are tender.\n10.

While there are innumerable ways of boiling rice and there appears to be no set formula, keeping a few things in mind is useful. (1) Washing the rice thoroughly and repeatedly helps get rid of the starch that usually contributes to its stickiness. (2) Rice, like pasta, must be boiled in a large pot of water. The water must measure at least 5 times in volume than the volume of uncooked rice. Doing so dilutes the starch and ensures that most of it gets drained out at the end, along with the water. (3) Once the rice is cooked to the desired softness, use a large strainer to remove the excess water.

With a bit of organisation, you can get a batch done in no time, and with minimal cleaning-up to do after. As for tools, all you need is a pair of scissors. Apart from that, keep a bin or plastic bag ready to catch the discarded shells and a bowl for the clean prawns. Put on a playlist, podcast, or audiobook of your choice. This last step is optional, but you might as well be entertained while cleaning up some crustacean.\n\nNow, coming to the anatomy of the prawn, consider the parts you want to keep, and those you want to throw away. We usually eat fleshy bits, and discard the shells and other scalier parts. For most Bengali dishes, including _chingri malai curry_ and _chingri bhaape_, we leave the head and tail of the prawn intact—the head contains all the wonderful flavour and tasty, creamy goodness, while the tail adds a nice presentation detail.\n\n***\n\n**TIME TAKEN** 20 minutes for 500 g of prawns\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient |\n|----------|------------|\n|    500 g | Prawns     |\n\n## Equipment\n- A pair of scissors\n- A dish or bag for scraps\n- A bowl or plate for clean prawns\n\n## Things to remove\n- The snout\n- The eyes\n- The walking legs\n- The shell\n- The vein\n\n## Things to keep\n- The body or the fleshy part\n- The head (for flavour and taste)\n- The tail (for presentation)\n\n## Method\n1. Use your scissors and cut off the snout, which is located on the head of the prawn, between the eyes.\n2. Next, snip off the eyes.\n3. Gather together all the walking legs (can be found under the head) and snip them off with your scissors as well.\n4. Now, hold the prawn so that its head faces you, and its dorsal side is pointed upward. Cut through the shell along the (non-existent) spine of the prawn, from the head all the way to the tail.\n5. You should now be able to peel off the shell. If it gets stuck anywhere, give it a tug and it should come loose easily.\n6. Locate the vein along the spine of the prawn.\n7.

Place them in a microwaveable bowl with 6 g of salt and 2 tablespoons of water.\n3. Cover with cling film and microwave for 3 minutes. Alternatively, you can also boil them on the stove till partially cooked.\n4. Set aside.\n\n  **PART III—PREPARING THE CURRY**\n1. Now, heat 20 g mustard oil in a pan.\n2. Temper the oil with the _phoron_ (dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds).\n3. Once the whole spices start to crackle in oil, add the chopped onions and sugar to the pan and fry on medium heat for 5–7 minutes.\n4. Add the ginger paste and minced garlic to the pan, and fry for another 3–4 minutes.\n5. Make a spice paste by adding 50 g water to the cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and salt.\n6. Add this mixture to the pan and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n7. Then, add another 50g of water, along with the tomatoes and green chilli, and cook till the water dries off again.\n8. Add the parboiled potatoes and cook on low heat for 2 minutes.\n9. Then add the eggs. Cook for another minute. Stop here if you want _dim’er kosha_, a rich gravy to accompany your fried rice or _luchi_. For a lighter curry to eat with steamed rice, proceed to the next step.\n10. Now, add 225 g hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n11. Boil for 5–7 minutes with the lid on before removing from the heat.\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Steamed rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- Fried rice\n- Luchi\n","source":"_posts/dimer-dalna.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Dim’er Dalna or Duck Egg Curry\ndescription: The ultimate Bengali egg curry made with duck eggs-boiled, fried golden, then cooked in onion-garlic-ginger-tomato-garam masala sauce.\ntags:\n  - dalna\n  - curry\n  - egg\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1488865263/dimer-dalna-website_xexmyd.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: bMuoNOjW4Wc\ndate: 2016-07-28 21:39:47\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Dim'er dalna\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1488865263/dimer-dalna-website_xexmyd.jpg\",\"description\":\"This is a hearty, filling curry.

Cook for another minute. Stop here if you want <em>dim’er kosha</em>, a rich gravy to accompany your fried rice or <em>luchi</em>. For a lighter curry to eat with steamed rice, proceed to the next step.</li>\n<li>Now, add 225 g hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.</li>\n<li>Boil for 5–7 minutes with the lid on before removing from the heat.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Served-with\"><a href=\"#Served-with\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Served with\"></a>Served with</h2><ul>\n<li><a href=\"/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/\">Steamed rice</a></li>\n<li>Fried rice</li>\n<li>Luchi</li>\n</ul>"},{"title":"Ilish Machh’er Tel Jhol","description":"A hearty Bengali Ilish (Hilsa) curry that takes just six ingredients and 30 minutes to cook.","thumbnailImagePosition":"top","thumbnailImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1502409865/ilish-tel-jhol-website-thumbnail-_copy_fgqkru.jpg","coverMeta":"out","coverSize":"partial","videoId":"eozV_33nz7c","date":"2017-08-09T03:30:00.000Z","jsonLd":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Recipe","name":"Ilish Macher Jhol","author":"Bong Eats","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1502409865/ilish-tel-jhol-website-thumbnail-_copy_fgqkru.jpg","description":"A hearty Bengali Ilish (Hilsa) curry that takes just six ingredients and 30 minutes to cook.","prepTime":"PT5M","totalTime":"PT30M","recipeYield":"5","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"5 servings","calories":"339 calories","fatContent":"19.4 g","carbohydrateContent":"7.3 g","proteinContent":"21.8 g"},"recipeIngredient":["500 g Ilish machh (hilsa fish, 3-cm-thick pieces)","100 g Brinjal (5cm chunks)","40 g Mustard oil (for cooking and garnish)","5 pcs Green chillies (slit)","¼ tsp Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)","18 g Salt","6 g Turmeric powder","¼ tsp Atta (flour)","350 g Hot water"],"recipeInstructions":["1.

We can be mindful <em>not to buy any hilsa</em> that is under 500 g / 25 cm. Catching of hilsa before the spawning stage is detrimental to the progression of the next generation. It is equally important also to <em>not buy hilsa during the breeding season</em> (especially October to November, but even better, until March). In 2016, Bangaldesh was able to <a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/806667/how-king-hilsa-made-a-comeback\">increase its hilsa yield</a> by 50 per cent by putting measures in place to ban fishing in the breeding season. It also laid down and imposed specifications for net size to prevent the catching of juvenile hilsa. There is a need to create more consciousness about the importance of conserving a fish that is perhaps Bengal’s greatest cultural icon.</p>\n<p><strong> How can you help? </strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Don’t to buy any hilsa that is under 500 g / 25 cm.

Soak mustard seeds overnight in water.","2. Clean the ilish machh and cut it in 3-cm thick slices. Kolapaturi is best made with thick slices of fish. Set these pieces aside, preferably on a flat plate.","3. Drain the mustard seeds of the water they’ve been soaking in and add them to a grinder jar. Add 4 green chillies, roughly chopped, along with 100g water. Grinding green chillies with the mustard ensures that it doesn’t turn bitter.","4. Grind these to a fine paste. Take your time with this process. Scrape down the sides of the jar and grind as many times as it takes to form the smoothest possible paste. The finer the grind, the better the flavours.","5. Now, add the peeled and chopped coconut to the grinder jar, along with salt, sugar, and turmeric powder. Grind once again till everything is smooth and well combined.","6. Transfer this paste to a mixing bowl. Add the beaten yoghurt and mustard oil. Mix till the oil is fully incorporated.","7. Spoon this mixture over the ilish machh, dividing it equally.

Meanwhile, wash and cut up some kolapata into rectangular sheets, 20 cm by 50 cm in dimension. Gently toast them on a pan set on medium heat. This will increase malleability of the banana leaves, ensuring that they don’t crack when folded. Remove from heat and set aside.","9. Take a banana-leaf sheet in front of you. Spoon some mustard paste in the centre of one of the sheet. Set one piece of the fish on it. Top off with some more of the paste and a split green chilli.","10. Carefully wrap the fish with the banana leaf making sure that it is fully covered. If you find that your leaf is torn, wrap another layer of leaf around it.

Soak mustard seeds overnight in water.\n2. Clean the _ilish machh_ and cut it in 3-cm thick slices. _Kolapaturi_ is best made with thick slices of fish. Set these pieces aside, preferably on a flat plate.\n3. Drain the mustard seeds of the water they’ve been soaking in and add them to a grinder jar. Add 4 green chillies, roughly chopped, along with 100g water. Grinding green chillies with the mustard ensures that it doesn’t turn bitter. \n4. Grind these to a fine paste. Take your time with this process. Scrape down the sides of the jar and grind as many times as it takes to form the smoothest possible paste. The finer the grind, the better the flavours.\n5. Now, add the peeled and chopped coconut to the grinder jar, along with salt, sugar, and turmeric powder. Grind once again till everything is smooth and well combined. \n6. Transfer this paste to a mixing bowl. Add the beaten yoghurt and mustard oil. Mix till the oil is fully incorporated. \n7. Spoon this mixture over the _ilish machh_, dividing it equally. Turn the fish over and coat the other side as well. Use your hands to make sure every part of the fish, including its cavities, are well coated. Set it aside to marinate for 15 minutes.\n8. Meanwhile, wash and cut up some _kolapata_ into rectangular sheets, 20 cm by 50 cm in dimension. Gently toast them on a pan set on medium heat. This will increase malleability of the banana leaves, ensuring that they don’t crack when folded. Remove from heat and set aside.\n9. Take a banana-leaf sheet in front of you. Spoon some mustard paste in the centre of one of the sheet. Set one piece of the fish on it. Top off with some more of the paste and a split green chilli.\n10. Carefully wrap the fish with the banana leaf making sure that it is fully covered. If you find that your leaf is torn, wrap another layer of leaf around it. Tie this parcel up securely with a cotton string (don’t use synthetic or it will melt when heated). \n11. Add a tablespoon of oil to the _tawa_ (pan). Once hot, place the parcels on it side by side. \n12. Cover and steam the banana-leaf parcels on low heat for 5 minutes on each side.\n13.

Once the oil is hot, add 60 g of the finely chopped onions. Fry till they turn golden in colour (about 5 minutes).\n3. Add 2 green chillies, finely chopped, and fry them for another minute.\n4. Next, add the minced meat. Using your spatula, break up the lumps in the mince.\n5. Stir in 5 g of salt and 1 tsp of [Shahi garam masala powder](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/) powder.\n6.

If your mince is particularly fatty, scoop out the excess rendered fat till the keema appears dry.\n8. Transfer the cooked mince to a grinder jar and blitz in short pulses till it is completely smooth. Since the keema is dry, this process might take some time and patience. Scrape down the sides of the jar every so often and pulse again till smooth.\n9. Once the mince is perfectly ground, transfer it to a mixing bowl.\n10. Add the boiled potatoes and mash them in.\n11. Also add half a beaten egg, 2 chopped green chillies, and 25 g chopped onions. Combine everything until you have a dough-like mixture.\n12. Portion the mixture into 12 balls, each weighing 30 g. Press each ball in your fist to compact the ground mince. Then, roll it between your palms to form a smooth, crack-free ball.\n13. In a frying pan, heat vegetable oil, about 4-cm deep.\n14. Fry the balls till they are brown. Since the mince is already cooked, these koftas brown very quickly (in under a minute), so be prepared to extract them from the oil accordingly.\n15. Drain from the oil and set aside.\n\n**STEP III—ASSEMBLY**\n1. Melt some ghee in the microwave or on the stove. Get the yoghurt mixture out of the fridge.\n2. In individual serving bowls, add the fried koftas. Drizzle some melted ghee on them. Top with generous portions of the beaten yoghurt mixture and a few dollops of tamarind sauce.

Using a slicer, cut the potatoes into 2-mm-thick slices. Alternatively, you can also use a sharp knife cut thin slices by hand. Reserve the slices in a large bowl of water to prevent the potatoes from oxidizing.\n2. Wash the potato slices in plenty of water to remove the starch. Doing so will allow the _alu bhaja_ to crisp up nicely. Change the water 2–3 times during this process to make sure that most of the starch is gone. Drain the water when done.\n3. Now, lay out absorbent towels on a surface and spread out the washed potato slices in a single layer. We want the potatoes to be completely dry before we move on to the next stage—moisture will make the fries limp. Take your time. Dab them with another towel, or let them air dry for long as it takes for them to be completely dry.\n4. Bunch together 5–6 slices at a time, and chop them into matchsticks, 2-mm-wide.\n5. Heat about 500 g vegetable oil in a pan. The secret to non-greasy fries is to use a lot of oil. The excessive amount of oil will allow the potato juliennes to float freely, rather than lump together and trap steam. The temperature of the oil is also important for this recipe. It should be adequately hot (at around 180°C), but should never reach the smoking point.\n6. Once the oil is hot, fry the peanuts for 20 seconds, drain, and reserve for later. Do the same with the curry leaves, frying them for 10 seconds.\n7. Now, drop a small handful of potatoes into the oil. It is important not to overcrowd the pan. When the potatoes hit the oil, they will release a lot of steam. With time, the bubbles will gradually start subsiding (in about 3 minutes or so). The process of frying essentially serves to dehydrate the potatoes—and _that_ is what lets them turn crisp, and stay crisp, longer. When the moisture has evaporated as steam bubbles, you know that the _alu bhaja_ is crunchy. Fry for another 2 minutes for it to develop colour.\n7. Strain the _alu bhaja_ from the oil, and transfer to a perforated vessel (such as a colander or wicker basket) to cool. A basket allows the remaining steam to get out. Otherwise the steam will condense into water as the fries cool, making them limp.\n8. Garnish with the fried peanuts and curry leaves.\n9. FOR THE SEASONING, mix together the freshly ground pepper, salt, rock salt, chaat masala, and red chilli powder in the given proportions. Sprinkle this mix on the _alu bhaja_ just before eating. Salt, being hygroscopic, tends to absorb moisture from the air, and turn the crisps soggy.

Three important things need to be kept in mind: (1) The cut potatoes should be washed in plenty of water to rid them of starch; (2) before frying, the potatoes must be thoroughly dried—any moisture will yield limp fries; and (3) the potato juliennes must be fried in a pan full of oil, at a steady temperature of 180°C (that is, the oil should be hot, but not so hot that it begins to smoke).</p>\n\n<p>Without further ado, let’s get into the step-by-step guide to making the perfectly crisp <em>jhuri alu bhaja</em> every single time.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 45 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 8 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>400 g</td>\n<td>Potatoes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25 g</td>\n<td>Peanuts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 sprig</td>\n<td>Curry leaves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>500 g</td>\n<td>Vegetable oil (for frying)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Pepper (crushed)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Rock salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Chaat masala</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pinch</td>\n<td>Red chilli powder</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Any good slicer</li>\n<li>Sharp knife</li>\n<li>2–3 clean, absorbent towels</li>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan</li>\n<li>Frying spoon | perforated spoon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Using a slicer, cut the potatoes into 2-mm-thick slices. Alternatively, you can also use a sharp knife cut thin slices by hand. Reserve the slices in a large bowl of water to prevent the potatoes from oxidizing.</li>\n<li>Wash the potato slices in plenty of water to remove the starch. Doing so will allow the <em>alu bhaja</em> to crisp up nicely. Change the water 2–3 times during this process to make sure that most of the starch is gone. Drain the water when done.</li>\n<li>Now, lay out absorbent towels on a surface and spread out the washed potato slices in a single layer. We want the potatoes to be completely dry before we move on to the next stage—moisture will make the fries limp. Take your time. Dab them with another towel, or let them air dry for long as it takes for them to be completely dry.</li>\n<li>Bunch together 5–6 slices at a time, and chop them into matchsticks, 2-mm-wide.</li>\n<li>Heat about 500 g vegetable oil in a pan. The secret to non-greasy fries is to use a lot of oil. The excessive amount of oil will allow the potato juliennes to float freely, rather than lump together and trap steam. The temperature of the oil is also important for this recipe. It should be adequately hot (at around 180°C), but should never reach the smoking point.</li>\n<li>Once the oil is hot, fry the peanuts for 20 seconds, drain, and reserve for later. Do the same with the curry leaves, frying them for 10 seconds.</li>\n<li>Now, drop a small handful of potatoes into the oil. It is important not to overcrowd the pan. When the potatoes hit the oil, they will release a lot of steam. With time, the bubbles will gradually start subsiding (in about 3 minutes or so). The process of frying essentially serves to dehydrate the potatoes—and <em>that</em> is what lets them turn crisp, and stay crisp, longer. When the moisture has evaporated as steam bubbles, you know that the <em>alu bhaja</em> is crunchy. Fry for another 2 minutes for it to develop colour.</li>\n<li>Strain the <em>alu bhaja</em> from the oil, and transfer to a perforated vessel (such as a colander or wicker basket) to cool. A basket allows the remaining steam to get out. Otherwise the steam will condense into water as the fries cool, making them limp.</li>\n<li>Garnish with the fried peanuts and curry leaves.</li>\n<li>FOR THE SEASONING, mix together the freshly ground pepper, salt, rock salt, chaat masala, and red chilli powder in the given proportions. Sprinkle this mix on the <em>alu bhaja</em> just before eating. Salt, being hygroscopic, tends to absorb moisture from the air, and turn the crisps soggy. Without the seasoning, the <em>alu bhaja</em> should keep for up to 7 days in an airtight container.  </li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Served-with\"><a href=\"#Served-with\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Served with\"></a>Served with</h2><ul>\n<li><a href=\"/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/\">Rice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/tags/dal/\">Dal</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"title":"Khichuri","description":"The Bengali variant of the ever-pervasive South Asian ‘khichdi’, made with nutty, roasted moong dal and fragrant gobindobhog rice.","thumbnailImagePosition":"top","thumbnailImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1495139176/panta-bhaat-website-thumbnail-_jlcqgn.jpg","coverMeta":"out","coverSize":"partial","videoId":"h5EloI7HDZc","date":"2017-07-07T03:30:00.000Z","jsonLd":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Recipe","name":"Khichuri","author":"Bong Eats","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1499391762/khichuri_ah4gtb.jpg","description":"The Bengali variant of the ever-pervasive South Asian ‘khichdi’, made with nutty, roasted moong dal and fragrant gobindobhog rice.","prepTime":"PT15M","totalTime":"PT75M","recipeYield":"8","recipeIngredient":["200 g Moong dal","200 g Gobindobhog rice","200 g Potatoes (5 cm chunks)","200 g Cauliflower (5 cm florets)","100 g Tomatoes (quartered)","80 g Peas (blanched)","2 g Cumin seeds","3 pcs Cardamom (whole)","1 pc Cinnamon (whole)","3 pcs Cloves (whole)","3 pcs Dried red chillies","4 pcs Bay leaves","40 g Ginger paste","40 g Grated coconut","5 g Turmeric powder","5 g Cumin powder","25 g Salt","50 g Sugar","5 pcs Green chillies (slit)","10 g Ghee","½ tsp Garam masala powder","20 g Vegetable oil","15 g Mustard oil","1.8 litres Hot water"],"recipeInstructions":["1.

Chopping off the root will ensure that each strand separates from the rest.","Heat vegetable oil, 3 cm deep, on medium heat. Once hot, drop a handful of the onion slices. Be sure not to overcrowd the pan; the onions must fry in a single layer.","Using a fork, move the onions around every so often so that they fry evenly.","Just as the onions start to turn golden (do not wait until they have already turned golden), start removing them from the pan and draining them over a perforated vessel such as a colander or jhuri. Keep a close watch, as the onions tend to burn very quickly towards the end. Remove them from the oil before they have taken on the desired colour; they will continue to cook in the residual heat.","Allow them to cool and crisp up. This caramelised onion is called birasta and it is used in several Mughlai preparations. Raw onions weighing 650 g should yield about 165 g birasta (so about 25 per cent the weight of raw onions). It can be stored in an airtight container for 2 to 3 weeks.","Using a grinder or mortar and pestle, form a smooth paste of 15 g ginger, 10 g garlic, and 10 g green chillies. Set aside.","In a kadai, heat 35 g vegetable oil. Once hot, fry the meat in batches, from all sides, till it is golden. Browning the meat enhances the flavour of the dish.","Remove from the pan and set aside.","Temper the same oil with bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns.","Add 350 g sliced onions, along with 15 g salt. Stirring intermittently, fry on medium heat for about 10 minutes till the onions turn brown.","Next, add in the ginger-garlic-green-chilli paste and fry for another 3 minutes, until the smell of the raw spices is gone.","Add shahi garam masala powder and 35 g of the birasta we prepared earlier. Using a combination of sautéed and caramelised onions adds a depth of flavour to the preparation.","Add the browned pieces of meat to the onion mixture and sauté for about 2 minutes.","Transfer everything from the kadai to a pressure cooker. Add 1.5 kg of water, close the lid, and pressure cook for about 1 hour. The meat should be completely soft by this stage, such that it easily falls off the bone.","Pick out the meat pieces from the pressure cooker. Just as they are cool enough to handle, remove the bones, cartilage, and any hard, unrendered collagen that is still in the meat. Discard these, along with the bay leaves.","You should now be left with a gorgeous meaty broth, and some boneless pieces of tender meat. At this stage, you can put the meat and broth in the fridge and complete the rest of the preparation the following day.","Chop the meat, against the grain, into 3-cm chunks. Chilling the meat before chopping hardens the collagen rendered from the meat, making it easy to cut into cubes.","Divide the meat into two piles. The first will be ground along with the grains, and the second added whole to the haleem towards the end.","Strain the water from the soaked grains, and transfer the latter to a heavy-bottomed pan. Add the broth we prepared earlier to the pan. (If you placed the broth in the fridge overnight, do not forget to first bring it to boil before adding it to the grains.)","Also add 18 g of salt and the first pile of the chopped meat.","On low heat, let it all bubble for at least one hour, stirring occasionally, till the the grains are soft. Boiling the grains in the broth rather than in water intensifies the meaty flavour of the dish.","Transfer the boiled grains into a blender and grind till everything breaks down. However, be careful not to reduce everything to a uniform, smooth paste, as we want some semblance of texture. Depending on the size of your blender jar, you may have to do this in batches.","Return the haleem to the pan. Add the remaining chunks of meat, along with 650 g hot milk. Mix until uniform. Bring to a boil before turning off the heat.","For the garnish, julienne some ginger, cut limes into wedges, split green chillies lengthwise, and finely chop the mint leaves.","Drop ladles of the haleem into a serving dish. Top it with a generous amount of birasta and chopped mint leaves.","Heat a pan till it is extremely hot. Add a spoonful of ghee and wait for it to smoke. Then add some julienned ginger and split green chillies. Fry for about 5 seconds and pour the contents of the pan (along with the ghee) over the serving dish."]},"_content":"\n\n<p class=\"post-byline\">A slow-cooked stew of meat, grains, and pulses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Of the many migrant communities that make up the rich tapestry of Calcutta's modern history, the Bohra Muslims might not be the most visible, but they are a thriving culture. By some accounts, Calcutta is estimated to have under 5,000 'Bohris'. Mostly traders and businessfolk, the earliest settlers arrived in the city from western parts of India in the late 1800s</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">K</span>_hichro_ is a typically Bohra Muslim preparation. Like the more popular _haleem_ found in Calcutta during Ramzan, _khichro_ is made by slowly cooking meat and grains together till the meat falls off the bone. _Khichro_ is a special dish, being most prominently consumed communally on the tenth day of Muharram by Bohras across the globe, but it is also a very homely preparation, eaten throughout the year. It is deceptively light. In spite of the fact that a lot of onions, spices, meat, milk, and ghee goes into the dish, it is, underneath all that, a very hearty porridge of various kinds of grains. The _khichro_ is distinctive in that it is pale in colour; it doesn’t make use of turmeric powder, chilli powder, jeera powder, and other such spices. Apart from meat, its main ingredient is broken wheat (dalia can also be used), whereas _haleem_ is made predominantly with a mixture of dals.\n\n| Day 1                             | Day 2                        |  \n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Soaking grains                    | Chopping meat                |\n| Making _birasta_                  | Cooking grains               |\n| Cooking meat                      | Blending everything together |\n| Separating meat, stock, and bones | Garnishing                   |\n\n\n**COOKING TIME** 5 hours   \n**YIELDS** 6 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|         Quantity | Ingredient                            |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|       **GRAINS** |                                       |\n|            180 g | Broken wheat or dalia                 |\n|             30 g | Masoor dal                            |\n|             30 g | Moong dal                             |\n|             30 g | Chhola’r dal                          |\n|             30 g | Rice                                  |\n| **FOR THE MEAT** |                                       |\n|            800 g | Beef (or any red meat of your choice) |\n|             1 kg | Onions                                |\n|             15 g | Ginger                                |\n|             10 g | Garlic                                |\n|             10 g | Green chillies                        |\n|            6 pcs | Cardamom (whole)                      |\n|            2 pcs | Cinnamon (whole)                      |\n|            6 pcs | Cloves (whole)                        |\n|           10 pcs | Peppercorns                           |\n|            2 pcs | Bay leaves                            |\n|              3 g | [Shahi garam masala powder](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/)             |\n|             33 g | Salt                                  |\n|      **LIQUIDS** |                                       |\n|           1.5 kg | Water                                 |\n|            650 g | Milk                                  |\n|          **FAT** |                                       |\n|            250 g | Vegetable oil                         |\n|             50 g | Ghee                                  |\n|      **GARNISH** |                                       |\n|          1 bunch | Mint leaves                           |\n|             40 g | Ginger                                |\n|        12 wedges | Lime                                  |\n|            6 pcs | Green chillies                        |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Large dish or pot (for soaking grains)\n- Heavy-bottomed boiling pot with lid\n- Pressure cooker\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- _Khhunti_ | long stapula\n- _Jhhajhhri_ | perforated frying spoon\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Grinder\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—SOAKING GRAINS**\n1. Take the broken wheat, dals, and rice in a bowl. Rinse them well and soak overnight, for at least 12 hours.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING ONIONS (_BIRASTA_)**\n1. Slice 650g onions thinly, cutting off the root that holds the bulb together.\n2. Using you hand, scrunch up the slices to separate each layer. Chopping off the root will ensure that each strand separates from the rest.\n3. Heat vegetable oil, 3 cm deep, on medium heat. Once hot, drop a handful of the onion slices. Be sure not to overcrowd the pan; the onions must fry in a single layer.\n4. Using a fork, move the onions around every so often so that they fry evenly.\n5. Just as the onions start to turn golden (do not wait until they have already turned golden), start removing them from the pan and draining them over a perforated vessel such as a colander or _jhuri_. Keep a close watch, as the onions tend to burn very quickly towards the end. Remove them from the oil _before_ they have taken on the desired colour; they will continue to cook in the residual heat.\n6. Allow them to cool and crisp up. This caramelised onion is called _birasta_ and it is used in several Mughlai preparations. Raw onions weighing 650 g should yield about 165 g _birasta_ (so about 25 per cent the weight of raw onions). It can be stored in an airtight container for 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n**STEP III—COOKING MEAT**\n1. Using a grinder or mortar and pestle, form a smooth paste of 15 g ginger, 10 g garlic, and 10 g green chillies. Set aside.\n2. In a _kadai_, heat 35 g vegetable oil. Once hot, fry the meat in batches, from all sides, till it is golden. Browning the meat enhances the flavour of the dish.\n3. Remove from the pan and set aside.\n4. Temper the same oil with bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns.\n5. Add 350 g sliced onions, along with 15 g salt. Stirring intermittently, fry on medium heat for about 10 minutes till the onions turn brown.\n6. Next, add in the ginger-garlic-green-chilli paste and fry for another 3 minutes, until the smell of the raw spices is gone.\n7. Add [_Shahi garam masala_](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/) powder and 35 g of the _birasta_ we prepared earlier. Using a combination of sautéed and caramelised onions adds a depth of flavour to the preparation.\n8. Add the browned pieces of meat to the onion mixture and sauté for about 2 minutes.\n10. Transfer everything from the _kadai_ to a pressure cooker. Add 1.5 kg of water, close the lid, and pressure cook for about 1 hour. The meat should be completely soft by this stage, such that it easily falls off the bone.\n\n**STEP IV—SEPARATING MEAT, BROTH, AND BONES**\n1. Pick out the meat pieces from the pressure cooker. Just as they are cool enough to handle, remove the bones, cartilage, and any hard, unrendered collagen that is still in the meat. Discard these, along with the bay leaves.\n2. You should now be left with a gorgeous meaty broth, and some boneless pieces of tender meat. At this stage, you can put the meat and broth in the fridge and complete the rest of the preparation the following day.\n\n**STEP V—CHOPPING MEAT**\n1. Chop the meat, against the grain, into 3-cm chunks. Chilling the meat before chopping hardens the collagen rendered from the meat, making it easy to cut into cubes.\n2. Divide the meat into two piles. The first will be ground along with the grains, and the second added whole to the haleem towards the end.\n\n**STEP VI—BOILING GRAINS**\n1. Strain the water from the soaked grains, and transfer the latter to a heavy-bottomed pan. Add the broth we prepared earlier to the pan. (If you placed the broth in the fridge overnight, do not forget to first bring it to  boil before adding it to the grains.)\n2. Also add 18 g of salt and the first pile of the chopped meat.\n3. On low heat, let it all bubble for at least one hour, stirring occasionally, till the the grains are soft. Boiling the grains in the broth rather than in water intensifies the meaty flavour of the dish.\n\n**STEP VII—BLENDING EVERYTHING**\n1. Transfer the boiled grains into a blender and grind till everything breaks down. However, be careful not to reduce everything to a uniform, smooth paste, as we want some semblance of texture. Depending on the size of your blender jar, you may have to do this in batches.\n2. Return the _haleem_ to the pan. Add the remaining chunks of meat, along with 650 g hot milk. Mix until uniform. Bring to a boil before turning off the heat.\n\n**STEP VIII—GARNISHING**\n1. For the garnish, julienne some ginger, cut limes into wedges, split green chillies lengthwise, and finely chop the mint leaves.\n2. Drop ladles of the _haleem_ into a serving dish. Top it with a generous amount of _birasta_ and chopped mint leaves.\n3. Heat a pan till it is extremely hot. Add a spoonful of ghee and wait for it to smoke. Then add some julienned ginger and split green chillies. Fry for about 5 seconds and pour the contents of the pan (along with the ghee) over the serving dish.\n\n\n## Served with\n- Bread rolls\n","source":"_posts/khichra-bohra-haleem.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Khichra—Bohra-Style Haleem\ntags:\n  - snack\n  - street food\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - ramzan recipe\n  - bohra recipe\ndescription: >-\n  Khichra, the Bohri version of haleem, is hearty dish is made by stewing meat, wheat and pulses.

By some accounts, Calcutta is estimated to have under 5,000 'Bohris'. Mostly traders and businessfolk, the earliest settlers arrived in the city from western parts of India in the late 1800s</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">K</span>_hichro_ is a typically Bohra Muslim preparation. Like the more popular _haleem_ found in Calcutta during Ramzan, _khichro_ is made by slowly cooking meat and grains together till the meat falls off the bone. _Khichro_ is a special dish, being most prominently consumed communally on the tenth day of Muharram by Bohras across the globe, but it is also a very homely preparation, eaten throughout the year. It is deceptively light. In spite of the fact that a lot of onions, spices, meat, milk, and ghee goes into the dish, it is, underneath all that, a very hearty porridge of various kinds of grains.

Chop the meat, against the grain, into 3-cm chunks. Chilling the meat before chopping hardens the collagen rendered from the meat, making it easy to cut into cubes.\n2. Divide the meat into two piles. The first will be ground along with the grains, and the second added whole to the haleem towards the end.\n\n**STEP VI—BOILING GRAINS**\n1. Strain the water from the soaked grains, and transfer the latter to a heavy-bottomed pan. Add the broth we prepared earlier to the pan. (If you placed the broth in the fridge overnight, do not forget to first bring it to  boil before adding it to the grains.)\n2. Also add 18 g of salt and the first pile of the chopped meat.\n3. On low heat, let it all bubble for at least one hour, stirring occasionally, till the the grains are soft. Boiling the grains in the broth rather than in water intensifies the meaty flavour of the dish.\n\n**STEP VII—BLENDING EVERYTHING**\n1. Transfer the boiled grains into a blender and grind till everything breaks down. However, be careful not to reduce everything to a uniform, smooth paste, as we want some semblance of texture. Depending on the size of your blender jar, you may have to do this in batches.\n2. Return the _haleem_ to the pan. Add the remaining chunks of meat, along with 650 g hot milk. Mix until uniform. Bring to a boil before turning off the heat.\n\n**STEP VIII—GARNISHING**\n1. For the garnish, julienne some ginger, cut limes into wedges, split green chillies lengthwise, and finely chop the mint leaves.\n2. Drop ladles of the _haleem_ into a serving dish. Top it with a generous amount of _birasta_ and chopped mint leaves.\n3. Heat a pan till it is extremely hot. Add a spoonful of ghee and wait for it to smoke. Then add some julienned ginger and split green chillies. Fry for about 5 seconds and pour the contents of the pan (along with the ghee) over the serving dish.\n\n\n## Served with\n- Bread rolls\n","slug":"khichra-bohra-haleem","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-17T06:35:22.907Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cj7ldrhrj001ntovht2zpriz5","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A slow-cooked stew of meat, grains, and pulses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Of the many migrant communities that make up the rich tapestry of Calcutta’s modern history, the Bohra Muslims might not be the most visible, but they are a thriving culture.

Smear the koi machh with ¾ tsp each of salt and turmeric till they are evenly coated. Set them aside.","2. Cut a cauliflower into chunky florets, about 5 cm large. Take as many florets as there are pieces of fish (in this case, five).","3. Peel and cut the potatoes lengthwise. Again, we need as many pieces of potatoes as there are fish.","4. Chop the tomato into quarters.","5. Heat a kadai till it is completely hot. Drizzle 30 g mustard oil into the pan till it starts smoking lightly, and changes colour from deep to pale yellow.","6. Add all the dal’er bori into the oil and fry them till they are golden. This should take about 15–20 seconds.","7. Remove the fried bori from the pan and set aside.","8. Now, add the cauliflower florets, along with ¼ tsp of salt, to the pan and fry them till they develop a light-brown colour. This should take about 4 minutes in all.","9. Remove the cauliflower from the pan and set aside.","10. Finally, add the marinated koi machh to the same oil, one at a time, and fry them for no longer than a minute on each side. Freshwater fish such as the koi benefit from a light fry, rather than a crusty one. So be sure not to sear the fish too much.","11. Remove the fish from the pan and set aside.","12. You now have fried bori, fried cauliflower, and fried fish ready for use at a later stage, and can now move on to the preparation of the curry.","13. At this point, inspect the oil in your pan. If it looks too burnt, replace it with 10 g of fresh mustard oil. If it is alright, use the same oil to cook the curry in as it contains all the flavour from the fried fish.","14. Temper the oil, set on medium heat, with the bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin seeds, and 2 slit green chillies.","15. Add the potatoes to the pan and fry them, with the lid on, for 4 minutes.","16. While the potatoes are frying, make a paste by combining cumin powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, salt, sugar, and 50 g water.","17. Add this mixture into the pan and fry it, with lid on, till the water dries up.","18. Now, add in the ginger paste and tomatoes, and incorporate them with the spices. Introduce another 50 g water to the pan and sauté the spices again till the water dries off.","19. The key here is to cover and cook because, alongside sautéing the spices, we also want to allow time for the potatoes to become tender.","20. Add in the fried cauliflower florets, fold them into the spices, and cook them for a minute or so.","21. Now, add 350 g of hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.","22. Once it comes to a boil, add in the fried bori, fried fish, and two (more) of the slit green chillies.","23. Using a spoon, gently try and submerge the fish in the curry. Be delicate as the fish is quite fragile at this stage.","24. Cover the pan and allow the curry to simmer for about 6 minutes.","25. Chop fresh coriander and add it to the pan. Let it simmer in the curry for another minute before turning off the heat."]},"_content":"\n\n\n<p class=\"post-byline\">Everyone’s favourite _machh’er jhol_ for the winter months</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">This is a light curry of the climbing perch fish (_koi machh_) and fried cauliflower florets.</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">K</span>_oi machh_ is a delicacy in Bengali cooking. Also known as the climbing perch fish because of its ability _climb_ out of water and walk on land for short distances, _koi machh_ is _always_ bought live at fish markets. It has an extremely slippery exterior, making the use of ash rather necessary while handling the fish for cleaning. Even if the _koi machh_ is scaled, degilled, and cleaned by your fish-seller, it might still be quite slimy to the touch. At home, you may need to rub the fish against an abrasive surface to get rid of the slipperiness (a perforated, steel colander-plate does this job quite well).\n\nComing to this recipe, its main ingredients, _koi machh_ and _phulkopi_ (cauliflower), are fried separately to enhance their flavours, and then added to the delicious _jhol_. The _jhol_ itself is a hot, gingery, _garam-masala_-infused curry that is mildly sweet, but never too spicy. It uplifts the taste of anything it gets soaked up in—potatoes, cauliflower, _bori_, or the fish. Eaten with a generous helping of steaming hot rice, this dish, the _phulkopi diye koi machh’er jhol_ is the Bengali’s favourite fish curry for the winter months.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 40 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|                         Quantity | Ingredient                        |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                             30 g | Mustard oil (for frying)          |\n|                             10 g | Mustard oil (for cooking)         |\n|              350 g (or 5 pieces) | Koi machh (climbing perch fish)   |\n|              150 g (or 5 pieces) | Cauliflower (5-cm florets)        |\n|              100 g (or 5 pieces) | Potatoes (cut lengthwise)         |\n|                        10 pieces | Dal’er bori                       |\n|                             20 g | Tomato (3-cm quarters)                |\n|                            ¼ tsp | Cumin seeds (whole)               |\n|                            2 pcs | Cardamom (whole)                  |\n|                          1 piece | Cinnamon (whole)                  |\n|                          1 piece | Bay leaf                          |\n|                         4 pieces | Green chillies (slit)             |\n|                              7 g | Ginger paste                      |\n|                             15 g | Cumin powder                      |\n|  4 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating) | Turmeric powder                   |\n|                              1 g | Red chilli powder                 |\n| 18 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating) | Salt                              |\n|                             15 g | Sugar                             |\n|                            350 g | Water (hot)                       |\n|                              6 g | Coriander leaves (finely chopped) |\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- Lid for the cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE INGREDIENTS**\n1. Smear the _koi machh_ with ¾ tsp each of salt and turmeric till they are evenly coated. Set them aside.\n2. Cut a cauliflower into chunky florets, about 5 cm large. Take as many florets as there are pieces of fish (in this case, five).\n3. Peel and cut the potatoes lengthwise. Again, we need as many pieces of potatoes as there are fish.\n4. Chop the tomato into 3-cm quarters.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE _BORI_, CAULIFLOWER, AND FISH**\n1. Heat a _kadai_ till it is completely hot. Drizzle 30 g mustard oil into the pan till it starts smoking lightly, and changes colour from deep to pale yellow.\n2. Add all the _dal’er bori_ into the oil and fry them till they are golden. This should take about 15–20 seconds. The bori tend to brown quickly, so stay on the watch.\n3. Remove the fried _bori_ from the pan and set aside.\n4. Now, add the cauliflower florets, along with ¼ tsp of salt, to the pan and fry them till they develop a light-brown colour. This should take about 4 minutes in all.\n5. Remove the cauliflower from the pan and set aside.\n6. Finally, add the marinated _koi machh_ to the same oil, one at a time, and fry them for no longer than a minute on each side. This is a freshwater fish with delicate flavours. So be sure not to sear the fish too long.\n7. Remove the fish from the pan and set aside.\n8. You now have fried _bori_, fried cauliflower, and fried fish ready for use at a later stage, and can now move on to the preparation of the curry.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING THE _JHOL_**\n1. At this point, inspect the oil in your pan. If it looks too burnt, replace it with 10 g of fresh mustard oil. If it is alright, use the same oil to cook the curry in as it contains all the flavour from the fried fish.\n2. Temper the oil, set on medium heat, with the bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin seeds, and 2 slit green chillies.\n3. Add the potatoes to the pan and fry them, with the lid on, for 4 minutes.\n4. While the potatoes are frying, make a paste by combining cumin powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, salt, sugar, and 50 g water.\n5. Add this mixture into the pan and fry it, with lid on, till the water dries up.\n6. Now, add in the ginger paste and the tomatoes, and incorporate them with the spices. Introduce another 50 g water to the pan and sauté the spices again till the water dries off.\n7. The key here is to cover and cook because, alongside sautéing the spices, we also want to allow time for the potatoes to become tender.\n8. Add in the fried cauliflower florets, fold them into the spices, and cook them for a minute or so.\n9. Now, add 350 g of hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n10. Once it comes to a boil, add in the fried _bori_, fried fish, and two (more) of the slit green chillies.\n11. Using a spoon, gently try and submerge the fish in the curry. Be delicate as the fish is quite fragile at this stage.\n12. Cover the pan and allow the curry to simmer for about 6 minutes.\n13. Chop fresh coriander and add it to the pan. Let it simmer in the curry for another minute before turning off the heat.\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n","source":"_posts/koi-machher-jhol-phulkopi-diye.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Koi Machh’er Jhol Phulkopi diye\ndescription: Video recipe for traditional Bengali fish curry made with koi fish simmered in a light gravy along with cauliflowers, bori and potatoes\ntags:\n  - fish\n  - koi machh\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1484875328/website-thumbnail-koi-phulkopi_c0rzir.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: q6q2PZLSOSI\ndate: 2017-01-19 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Koi Machh'er Jhol Phulkopi diye\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1484875490/thumbnail-small-koi-phulkopi_kb0bll.jpg\",\"description\":\"This is a light Bengali fish curry of the climbing perch (_koi machh_) and fried cauliflower florets.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT20M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT40M\",\"recipeYield\":\"5 servings\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"30 g  Mustard oil (for frying)\",\"10 g  Mustard oil (for cooking)\",\"350 g (or 5 pieces)  Koi machh (climbing perch fish)\",\"150 g (or 5 pieces)  Cauliflower (5-cm florets)\",\"100 g (or 5 pieces)  Potatoes (cut lengthwise)\",\"10 pieces  Dal’er bori\",\"20 g  Tomato (3-cm quarters)\",\"¼ tsp  Cumin seeds (whole)\",\"2 pcs  Cardamom (whole)\",\"1 piece  Cinnamon (whole)\",\"1 piece  Bay leaf\",\"4 pieces  Green chillies (slit)\",\"7 g  Ginger paste\",\"15 g  Cumin powder\",\"4 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating)  Turmeric powder\",\"1 g  Red chilli powder\",\"18 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating)  Salt\",\"15 g  Sugar\",\"350 g  Water (hot)\",\"6 g  Coriander leaves (finely chopped)\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

Also known as the climbing perch fish because of its ability <em>climb</em> out of water and walk on land for short distances, <em>koi machh</em> is <em>always</em> bought live at fish markets. It has an extremely slippery exterior, making the use of ash rather necessary while handling the fish for cleaning. Even if the <em>koi machh</em> is scaled, degilled, and cleaned by your fish-seller, it might still be quite slimy to the touch. At home, you may need to rub the fish against an abrasive surface to get rid of the slipperiness (a perforated, steel colander-plate does this job quite well).</p>\n<p>Coming to this recipe, its main ingredients, <em>koi machh</em> and <em>phulkopi</em> (cauliflower), are fried separately to enhance their flavours, and then added to the delicious <em>jhol</em>. The <em>jhol</em> itself is a hot, gingery, <em>garam-masala</em>-infused curry that is mildly sweet, but never too spicy. It uplifts the taste of anything it gets soaked up in—potatoes, cauliflower, <em>bori</em>, or the fish. Eaten with a generous helping of steaming hot rice, this dish, the <em>phulkopi diye koi machh’er jhol</em> is the Bengali’s favourite fish curry for the winter months.<br></p></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 40 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 5 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>30 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil (for frying)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil (for cooking)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>350 g (or 5 pieces)</td>\n<td>Koi machh (climbing perch fish)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>150 g (or 5 pieces)</td>\n<td>Cauliflower (5-cm florets)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g (or 5 pieces)</td>\n<td>Potatoes (cut lengthwise)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 pieces</td>\n<td>Dal’er bori</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 g</td>\n<td>Tomato (3-cm quarters)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Cumin seeds (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 pcs</td>\n<td>Cardamom (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 piece</td>\n<td>Cinnamon (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 piece</td>\n<td>Bay leaf</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 pieces</td>\n<td>Green chillies (slit)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7 g</td>\n<td>Ginger paste</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Cumin powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating)</td>\n<td>Turmeric powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 g</td>\n<td>Red chilli powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating)</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>350 g</td>\n<td>Water (hot)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 g</td>\n<td>Coriander leaves (finely chopped)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Mixing bowl</li>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan</li>\n<li>Lid for the cooking vessel</li>\n<li><em>Khunti</em> | long spatula</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><p><strong>STEP I—PREPPING THE INGREDIENTS</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Smear the <em>koi machh</em> with ¾ tsp each of salt and turmeric till they are evenly coated.

For the outer _paratha_/wrap, add the flour, salt, sugar, and _dalda_ to a mixing bowl. Combine the ingredients until the fat is well dispersed in the flour. Take your time and rub the flour between your fingers until it resembles breadcrumbs in texture. This will lead to a flakier crust.\n2. Now add the warm water and knead the dough for about 5 minutes until it is soft and smooth. Coat it with oil, cover the bowl, and allow it to rest for 30 minutes.\n3. Meanwhile, mix together finely sliced onions, chopped green chillies and the juice of half a lime. Pickling the onions in lime juice reduces their sharpness. If using cucumber, peel it and remove the central seeds. Then chop them into thin matchsticks. Create an assembly station where you gather all the items required for the filling. This will allow you to easily put together the roll once the _paratha_ is off the stove.\n4. Back to the dough: once it has rested, divide it in 130 g portions. For an extra-flaky exterior, we will roll the dough in the _lachcha paratha_ style, incorporating layers of flour and oil. To do this, form a ball and roll it out to a disc about 12 cm large. Apply a thin layer of oil on the surface and sprinkle some dry flour. Make an incision on the disc along a radius and roll it in the shape of a cone [WATCH THE VIDEO]. Press down to flatten. Rest the dough for about 5 minutes to relax it again, after which roll it for a second time to disc 22 cm in diameter.\n5. Beat an egg with a pinch of salt and keep at the ready.\n6. Heat about 4 tsp oil (12 g) in a flat frying pan or skillet. Add the _paratha_ and fry it on both sides until golden. Rotate the _paratha_ continuously, flipping often, for a uniform crust. Pay special attention to the sides to ensure that they crisp too. Once the _paratha_ is completely cooked, spread the beaten egg over it. Before it settles, turn over to fry the side with the egg. Transfer it to the assembly station, with the egg side facing up.\n7. Sprinkle it with _chaat masala_ and rocksalt. Add a row of the pickled onions a little off the centre of the _paratha_. Squeeze some lime juice over it. Top it with cucumber if you like. One of our favourite variations of the egg roll is the egg-potato roll. If we have it on hand, we like to add some leftover spicy _alu’r torkari_ as well. Finish everything off with a few squirts of ketchup.\n8. Form a tight roll, making sure the filling is all enclosed within the _paratha_. Wrap a paper around two-thirds of the roll and tuck any excess at the bottom.\n\n\n## Served with\n- Green chillies\n- Lime wedges\n- Thums up!","source":"_posts/kolkata-egg-roll.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Calcutta Egg Rolls\ntags:\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - street food\n  - Calcutta-style food\n  - snack\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1504209714/egg-roll-website_-thumbnail-_h4tzx1.png\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: 84iZjEzqpRE\ndate: 2017-08-31 20:30:00\ndescription:\njsonLd:\n---\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"post-byline\">Calcutta's most popular and iconic street food</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Of all the rolls, wraps, and frankies we have had, nothing comes close to a Calcutta roll—neither in taste, nor in sound architecture.</p>\n\n[_In this series, we tip our hats to some of our favourite dishes available in the restaurants, cafés, and cabins of Calcutta.

Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city.

But what makes a good roll? It should be served hot. So the assembly process, once the <em>paratha</em> has been fried,  needs to be quick and efficient. The outer shell, the <em>paratha</em> itself, must be flaky yet soft. It should not be too chewy, that is to say, you should not have to tug at it with your teeth. Most importantly, the <em>paratha</em> should be fully cooked and crisp. The filling should be evenly distributed so you get a little of everything with each bite. Finally, the mark of an excellently wrapped roll is that you can eat it using just one hand. Simply bite into your roll and when you reach the paper, gently grip the roll with your teeth to slide it out as you go along. No overflowing filling, no leaking sauces. Everything is contained within a neat package that you can enjoy on the go.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 1 hour<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 4<br><strong>CALORIES</strong> 530 kcal per paratha</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR THE WRAP</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>300 g</td>\n<td>Maida (flour)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16 g</td>\n<td>Dalda (shortening)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>180–200 g</td>\n<td>Warm water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR THE FILLING</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 pcs</td>\n<td>Eggs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>150 g</td>\n<td>Onions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 pcs</td>\n<td>Green chillies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 large</td>\n<td>Lime</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1–2 tsp</td>\n<td>Chaat masala</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1–2 tsp</td>\n<td>Rocksalt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>80 g</td>\n<td>Tomato ketchup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pc</td>\n<td>Cucumber (optional)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>~ 75 g</td>\n<td>Vegetable oil</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Mixing bowl</li>\n<li>Rolling pin</li>\n<li>Flat frying pan | skillet</li>\n<li><em>Khunti</em> | long spatula</li>\n<li>Sheets of thin, absorbent paper</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>For the outer <em>paratha</em>/wrap, add the flour, salt, sugar, and <em>dalda</em> to a mixing bowl.

Take 1 kg milk in a heavy-bottom saucepan and set it to boil.\n2. Once bubbling, stir in 45 g sugar.\n3. Keep boiling the milk, while stirring it continuously, for about 90 minutes.\n4. During this entire time, the pot should be on medium to low heat.\n5. At regular intervals of 3–4 minutes, scrape the solids from the bottom and sides of the pot, and incorporate them into the boiling milk. This step, as well as the previous one, is crucial. We don’t want our _kheer_ to burn at any point.\n6. Once the milk has reduced and thickened (when you lift some of it on your spoon and drop it, it should falls in clumps), make a paste of ¾ tsp flour and 1 tbsp milk.\n7. Add this paste to the pot. Stir and cook for another 5 minutes.\n8. Divide the _kheer_ into 10 portions of 20 g each.\n9. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least two hours.\n\n**STEP II—THE PASTRY DOUGH**\n1. In a mixing bowl, take 200 g flour, 40 g _ghee_, and 4 g salt. Mix these ingredients well till they take on a bread-crumb texture. The idea is to distribute the fat among the flour particles, in order to make the pastry crisp and flaky.\n2. Now, add in 80 g water.\n3. Mix until the dough comes together. This is a tight dough, so don’t add more water even if it seems a bit dry at first.\n4. Cover the dough and rest it for at least 20 minutes.\n\n**STEP III—SHAPING**\n1. Once the _kheer_ has chilled in the fridge for at least 2 hours, and the pastry dough is rested for at least 20 minutes, proceed to shaping each of them.\n2. Shape each 20 g portion of _kheer_ into 3 cm by 4 cm tablets. Put them back in the fridge to chill, till needed.\n3. Divide the dough in 10 portions of 30 g each.\n4. Shape each portion into a flat disc. Cover and rest, till needed.\n5. This proportion—20 g _kheer_ and 30 g dough—will give you the best filling to pastry ratio.\n\n**STEP IV—CONSTRUCTION**\n1. Roll each portion of the dough into a 14 cm disc, about 1 mm thick.\n2. Place a _kheer_ tablet at the centre of the disc.\n3. With your fingertips, apply water to the edges of the rolled pastry. This will act as a glue.\n4. Fold the opposite ends over one another, overlapping them. Press gently to seal.\n5. Turn the pastry over and apply water to the protruding wings. Fold them over each other, sealing them as you go.\n6. Use a clove to seal the topmost layer of the envelope in place.\n7. Follow these steps for all the pastries.\n\n**STEP V—THE SUGAR SYRUP**\n1. In a saucepan, add 400 g sugar and 200 g water.\n2. Cover with a lid, and set it on medium heat for about 10 minutes, or till the sugar syrup starts bubbling.\n3. For this recipe, we do not want a thick syrup. It should be the consistency of, say, packaged fruit juice.\n\n **STEP VI—THE SUGAR SYRUP**\n1. Heat oil in a frying pan to 150°C. The oil should be 5-cm deep.\n2. **_Lobongo lotika_ is not fried in hot oil like other deep-fried snacks or crisps. Since this pastry has a lot of layers of flour, we must fry it at low temperatures to ensure that all the layers cook through. If you try to fry it at a high temperature, the outside may look brown and done, but the inner layers will still be gummy.**\n3. Because of the slow frying, each batch of _lobongo lotika_ will take about 30 minutes to cook completely.  \n4. During this period, **turn them every five minutes** to ensure that the dough is getting cooked, and hardening, from both sides evenly. Otherwise, the _kheer_ may start to ooze out of the softer end.\n5. In case the filling leaks into the oil, you may remove the damaged pastry from the oil and put it inside an oven at 175°C for about 20 minutes.\n6. Once the pastries are golden-brown in colour, drain them from the oil and dunk them in the sugar syrup. Coat well, shake off the excess syrup, and place them on a plate to cool.  \n\n## Served with\n- Tea\n","source":"_posts/lobongo-lotika.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Lobongo Lotika\ntags:\n  - vegetarian\n  - snack\n  - sweets\ndescription: >-\n  Lobongo lotika is a flaky parcel, filled with kheer (sweetened, reduced milk), sealed with a clove, deep fried, and coated with sugar syrup.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1491526895/lobongo-lotika-website-thumbnail-_casq91.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: 7FiVDkUjkF4\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Lobongo Lotika\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1491526895/lobongo-lotika-website-thumbnail-_casq91.jpg\",\"description\":\"Lobongo lotika is a flaky parcel, filled with kheer (sweetened, reduced milk), sealed with a clove, deep fried, and coated with sugar syrup.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT30M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT180M\",\"recipeYield\":\"10 pieces\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"Whole milk 1 kg\",\"Sugar 445 g\",\"Water 280 g\",\"Maida (flour) 200 g\",\"Ghee 40 g\",\"Salt 4 g\",\"Vegetable oil (for deep frying) ~ 400 g\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

Take 1 kg milk in a heavy-bottom saucepan and set it to boil.\n2. Once bubbling, stir in 45 g sugar.\n3. Keep boiling the milk, while stirring it continuously, for about 90 minutes.\n4. During this entire time, the pot should be on medium to low heat.\n5. At regular intervals of 3–4 minutes, scrape the solids from the bottom and sides of the pot, and incorporate them into the boiling milk. This step, as well as the previous one, is crucial. We don’t want our _kheer_ to burn at any point.\n6. Once the milk has reduced and thickened (when you lift some of it on your spoon and drop it, it should falls in clumps), make a paste of ¾ tsp flour and 1 tbsp milk.\n7. Add this paste to the pot. Stir and cook for another 5 minutes.\n8. Divide the _kheer_ into 10 portions of 20 g each.\n9. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least two hours.\n\n**STEP II—THE PASTRY DOUGH**\n1. In a mixing bowl, take 200 g flour, 40 g _ghee_, and 4 g salt. Mix these ingredients well till they take on a bread-crumb texture. The idea is to distribute the fat among the flour particles, in order to make the pastry crisp and flaky.\n2. Now, add in 80 g water.\n3. Mix until the dough comes together. This is a tight dough, so don’t add more water even if it seems a bit dry at first.\n4. Cover the dough and rest it for at least 20 minutes.\n\n**STEP III—SHAPING**\n1. Once the _kheer_ has chilled in the fridge for at least 2 hours, and the pastry dough is rested for at least 20 minutes, proceed to shaping each of them.\n2. Shape each 20 g portion of _kheer_ into 3 cm by 4 cm tablets. Put them back in the fridge to chill, till needed.\n3. Divide the dough in 10 portions of 30 g each.\n4. Shape each portion into a flat disc. Cover and rest, till needed.\n5. This proportion—20 g _kheer_ and 30 g dough—will give you the best filling to pastry ratio.\n\n**STEP IV—CONSTRUCTION**\n1. Roll each portion of the dough into a 14 cm disc, about 1 mm thick.\n2. Place a _kheer_ tablet at the centre of the disc.\n3. With your fingertips, apply water to the edges of the rolled pastry. This will act as a glue.\n4. Fold the opposite ends over one another, overlapping them. Press gently to seal.\n5. Turn the pastry over and apply water to the protruding wings. Fold them over each other, sealing them as you go.\n6. Use a clove to seal the topmost layer of the envelope in place.\n7. Follow these steps for all the pastries.\n\n**STEP V—THE SUGAR SYRUP**\n1. In a saucepan, add 400 g sugar and 200 g water.\n2. Cover with a lid, and set it on medium heat for about 10 minutes, or till the sugar syrup starts bubbling.\n3. For this recipe, we do not want a thick syrup. It should be the consistency of, say, packaged fruit juice.\n\n **STEP VI—THE SUGAR SYRUP**\n1. Heat oil in a frying pan to 150°C. The oil should be 5-cm deep.\n2. **_Lobongo lotika_ is not fried in hot oil like other deep-fried snacks or crisps. Since this pastry has a lot of layers of flour, we must fry it at low temperatures to ensure that all the layers cook through. If you try to fry it at a high temperature, the outside may look brown and done, but the inner layers will still be gummy.**\n3. Because of the slow frying, each batch of _lobongo lotika_ will take about 30 minutes to cook completely.  \n4. During this period, **turn them every five minutes** to ensure that the dough is getting cooked, and hardening, from both sides evenly. Otherwise, the _kheer_ may start to ooze out of the softer end.\n5. In case the filling leaks into the oil, you may remove the damaged pastry from the oil and put it inside an oven at 175°C for about 20 minutes.\n6. Once the pastries are golden-brown in colour, drain them from the oil and dunk them in the sugar syrup. Coat well, shake off the excess syrup, and place them on a plate to cool.  \n\n## Served with\n- Tea\n","slug":"lobongo-lotika","published":1,"updated":"2017-04-07T01:48:46.648Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cj7ldrhrv001ytovhjvu1sbof","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">Pockets of <em>kheer</em>, sealed with a clove, deep fried, and coated with sugar syrup</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">This recipe calls for only six ingredients, all of which you undoubtedly have on hand.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">B</span>engali cuisine is no stranger to sweet tea-time snacks, and certainly not to those that involve <em>kheer</em>, flour, and deep-frying. <em>Lobongo lotika</em>, like <em>mishti shingara</em> and <em>goja</em>, is a flaky, deep-fried, sugar-syrup-coated pastry.

This recipe, _kumro’r jhal_, is defined by the heat and aroma that comes from freshly crushed green chillies and _kaalo jeere_. In a way, the green chilli and _kaalo jeere_ combination is a timeless one when it comes to Bengali cooking—these two work hand-in-hand to temper several classic dishes. In this recipe, these are not only used as _phoron_ but they are also pasted and added to the curry itself.

Bitter foods, in particular, are well-known antioxidants that contain immunity-boosting enzymes. In Bengal, these are generally consumed around springtime, when the weather transitions from chilly to hot and all manner of allergens/viruses are in the air. Over the years, Bengali cooks have devised clever and delicious ways to incorporate bitters in their diet—from fried _neem_ leaves to _korola bhaja_ to _shukto_.\n\n<p>Today we show you how to prepare _korola bhaja_—batter-fried rings of bitter gourd—in just 20 minutes. In this recipe, the _korola_ is twice cooked—first steamed and then fried. The batter itself is simple. It is mildly seasoned with some salt, sugar, and green chillies. _Nigella seeds_ provide a subtle fragrance, while _posto_ (poppy) adds crunch. We top it off with a drizzle of raw, pungent mustard oil for crispiness.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 20 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 4 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                      |\n|----------|---------------------------------|\n|    150 g | Bitter gourd (1-cm rings)       |\n|     50 g | Maida (all-purpose flour)       |\n|      3 g | Salt                            |\n|      8 g | Sugar                           |\n|  1 pinch | Turmeric powder                 |\n|  1 pinch | Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)     |\n|      2 g | Posto (poppy seeds)             |\n|  1 piece | Green chilli (finely chopped)   |\n|      5 g | Mustard oil                     |\n|     75 g | Water                           |\n|  ~ 250 g | Vegetable oil (for deep-frying) |\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Sauce pan | boiling pot (with lid)\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- Forks\n- _Jhhajhhri hata_ | perforated spoon\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n\n1.

It makes use of vegetable parts that would otherwise have been thrown away—the _lau’er khosha_ or peels of bottle gourd. Bengal has been unfortunate to witness a number of travesties throughout its history—two very major famines, the Partition, and a number of instances of large-scale migration. Even though the region has been blessed with agricultural abundance, these events, especially the famines, forced cooks to think of alternative means of sustenance. They turned to scraps, not-so-fresh vegetable rejects at the _bazaar_, and tough, fibrous parts of plants that no one thought to eat previously. The shrewd skills of the cooks, the women of the household, were called upon to make these throwaway items delectable. Several such recipes have survived to the modern day. Times may not be so tough, but the fact that we still actively seek out and prepare such dishes is testament to the sheer genius of our foremothers.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 20 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                        |\n|----------|-----------------------------------|\n|    175 g | Peels of lau (bottle gourd)       |\n|     15 g | Mustard oil (for frying)          |\n|  1 piece | Dried red chilli                  |\n|  1 piece | Bay leaf                          |\n|    ¼ tsp | Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)       |\n| 4 pieces | Dal’er bori                       |\n|      6 g | Grated coconut                    |\n|  1 piece | Green chilli (slit)               |\n|      3 g | Salt                              |\n|    ¼ tsp | Turmeric powder                   |\n|      6 g | Sugar                             |\n|      4 g | Coriander leaves (finely chopped) |\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Grater | grinder\n\n## Method\n1.

Now, using a sharp knife, start peeling the _lau_, keeping the peels as thin as possible, but making sure not to break them.\n3. Reserve the vegetable for use in another dish; for this recipe, we just need the peels.\n4. Take each peel, one by one, and start cutting it in 2mm-wide strips. Basically, we first thinly slice 6cm-long sections of the peel, and further julienne them in 2mm-wide matchsticks. Take your time with the cutting, as this will determine the texture of the finished product.\n5. Place the cut peels in a saucepan and cover them with water.\n6. Steam them with the lid on for 5 minutes. We don’t want to cook the peels at this stage, just parboil them.\n7. Strain over a colander and set aside.\n8. Heat 15 g mustard oil in a _kadai_ till lightly smoking.\n9. Add the _dal’er bori_ and fry them for about 20 seconds, till they are golden. Remove from the pan, roughly break them with your fingers into small shards, and set aside.\n10. Now, temper the same oil with a dried red chilli, bay leaf, and _kaalo jeere_.\n11. Add the parboiled peels and stir-fry them for 5 minutes.\n12. Add in the grated coconut and a slit green chilli, and stir-fry again for a minute.\n13. Next, introduce the salt and turmeric powder.

Divide the bottle gourd into 6–8 cm segments and remove its skin. Now, cut each segment into slices, 3 mm wide. Then bunch up about 3–4 of the slices at a time, and further cut them into matchsticks, 3 mm wide.\n2. In a small bowl, make a paste by mixing the ginger, turmeric, cumin powder, and 25 g water. Set aside.\n3. In a pan set on medium flame, add the _moong dal_.\n4. Dry-roast the _dal_, stirring continuously, till it changes colour to a pinkish-brown. This should take about 4 minutes.\n5. Once the _dal_ is roasted, remove it from the pan, and set aside for later.\n5. To the same pan set on medium heat, add 15 g mustard oil.\n6. Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, add in the _dal’er bori_.\n7. Fry the _boris_ till they turn golden. Drain from the oil and set aside for later.\n8.

You may add an additional 25 g water to the pan if the spices turn dry and start to stick to the bottom of the pan.\n11. Once the spices have fried, add in the roasted _moong dal_ and cook everything for 2 minutes.\n12. Then add all the shredded _lau_, along with the salt. Mix till the vegetable is coated with the spices.\n13. Cover the pan and let the _lau_ steam for a good 20 minutes. During this time, the salt will help draw the moisture from the gourd and soften it. Don’t forget to stir occasionally to ensure that the _lau_ doesn’t stick to the pan.\n14. Once the gourd is soft, add the sugar and slit green chillies. Cover and cook for another 8 minutes.\n15. Break the fried _bori_ into shards and add them to the pan, along with freshly chopped coriander leaves.

It differs from other stuffed _porotas_ in that filling cooks inside the _porota_, and that it is layered.\n\n_Mughlai porota_ can be made at home with a little bit of organisation. Plan for the following elements individually, and in this order:</p>\n1. **The _keema_**—This is an important component of the filling. We like to use cooked mutton or beef _keema_ (minced meat sautéed with onions, ginger, garlic, green chillies, turmeric, and _garam masala_). It needs to be prepared in advance.\n2. **The dough**—This will form the pastry within which the filling is enclosed. Be sure to knead the flour and set it to rest for at least 30 minutes.\n3. **The filling**—While your dough is resting, use this time to chop the onions, green chillies, ginger, and fresh coriander. Toast some peanuts and roughly crush them. Get the bread crumbs and salt out. Beat an egg in a bowl along with all the ingredients and your filling is ready to go!\n4. **The sides**—_Mughlai porota_ is served with a cabin-style salad of cucumber, onion, and beet, _alu'r torkari_, chicken or mutton _kosha_, and some ketchup. If you want some or all of these sides, be sure to prepare them before your start making the _mughlai_.\n5. **The _Mughlai porota_**—Now that the filling has been prepared, the sides are organised, and the dough has had time to rest, we are ready to bring all these elements together. See below for the full recipe.\n\n**COOKING TIME** 60 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 1 _mughlai porota_\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n**FOR THE POROTA/PASTRY**\n\n| Quantity | Ingredient                            |\n|----------|---------------------------------------|\n|     75 g | Flour                                 |\n|      1 g | Salt                                  |\n|      1 g | Sugar                                 |\n|      5 g | Oil                                   |\n|     40 g | Warm water                                 |\n\n**FOR THE FILLING**\n\n| Quantity | Ingredient                            |\n|----------|---------------------------------------|\n|  1 piece | Egg (beaten)                          |\n|     20 g | Keema (cooked mutton or beef keema)   |\n|     10 g | Onions (finely diced)                 |\n|      2 g | Green chillies (finely chopped)       |\n|      2 g | Ginger (finely diced)                 |\n|      3 g | Coriander (finely chopped)            |\n|      5 g | Peanuts (toasted and roughly chopped) |\n|     10 g | Bread crumbs                          |\n|      2 g | Salt                                  |\n|  ~300 ml | Oil for frying                        |\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl or dish\n- Rolling pin | large rolling surface\n- Frying pan\n- Frying spoon | _jhanjhri_\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**PART I—KNEADING THE DOUGH**\n1.

We like to use cooked mutton or beef _keema_ (minced meat sautéed with onions, ginger, garlic, green chillies, turmeric, and _garam masala_). It needs to be prepared in advance.\n2. **The dough**—This will form the pastry within which the filling is enclosed. Be sure to knead the flour and set it to rest for at least 30 minutes.\n3. **The filling**—While your dough is resting, use this time to chop the onions, green chillies, ginger, and fresh coriander. Toast some peanuts and roughly crush them. Get the bread crumbs and salt out. Beat an egg in a bowl along with all the ingredients and your filling is ready to go!\n4. **The sides**—_Mughlai porota_ is served with a cabin-style salad of cucumber, onion, and beet, _alu'r torkari_, chicken or mutton _kosha_, and some ketchup. If you want some or all of these sides, be sure to prepare them before your start making the _mughlai_.\n5. **The _Mughlai porota_**—Now that the filling has been prepared, the sides are organised, and the dough has had time to rest, we are ready to bring all these elements together.

Place the flour, salt, sugar, and 5 g oil in a mixing bowl, and distribute the ingredients evenly.\n2. Add 40 g warm water to the bowl and knead the dough for 5 minutes.\n3. Coat the dough with 2 tablespoons of oil, cover the bowl, and set aside for 30 minutes.\n\n**PART II—PREPARING THE FILLING**\n4. Finely dice the onions, and ginger, chop green chillies, and fresh coriander.\n5. Toast the peanuts in a pan till they are lightly coloured, and chop them roughly.\n6. Now, crack an egg in a bowl. Add in the cooked _keema_, onions, ginger, green chillies, coriander, peanuts, breads crumbs, and salt.\n7. Beat till all the ingredients are well combined.\n\n**PART III—ROLLING THE PASTRY**\n8. Oil your rolling surface and rolling pin.\n9. Place the dough on the surface and start rolling into a thin, rectangular sheet, about 2 mm thick, and 30 cm by 40 cm in dimension.\n\n**PART IV—BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER**\n10. In a frying pan, set over medium heat, pour vegetable oil till it reaches a height of about 3 cm from the bottom of the pan.    \n11. While the oil is heating up, place the filling in the centre of the rolled dough.\n12. Form an envelope by folding the sides of the rolled sheet inward, starting with the longer sides. Press down gently to seal.\n13. Now, fold the shorter sides such that the you have a pocket of filling, securely enclosed within the pastry sheet.\n14. Lower the _mughlai_ into the hot oil and fry on both sides till golden brown. Occasionally pat it down with the frying spoon to make sure that the filling is cooked thoroughly.\n15. Remove the _mughlai porota_ from the oil and place it on a chopping board. The residual heat will cook the egg to perfect doneness. Cut it into square segments and serve while still warm.\n\n## Served with\n- Alu’r torkari\n- Mutton or chicken kosha\n- Cabin-style salad\n- Ketchup\n","slug":"mughlai-porota","published":1,"updated":"2017-03-10T03:32:12.724Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cj7ldrhsi002otovh37scvevy","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A layered, deep-fried pastry filled with egg and minced meat</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Making this dish at home may seem like a daunting task.

This might seem like a tiny, inconsequential step (the process of tempering doesn’t take more than a few seconds), but no Bengali cook has ever skipped it. Is is what prepares the oil for cooking. In many cases, the choice of _phoron_ defines the flavour profile of the recipe (think of a dish like [_panchmishali torkari_](/recipe/panchmishali-torkari/), or a fish curry like _tel jhol_).

The Bengali version comprises _mouri_ (fennel seeds), _methi_ (fenugreek seeds), _kaalo jeere_ (nigella seeds), _shorshe_ (mustard seeds), and a typically Bengali spice, called _radhuni_. If you can’t find _radhuni_ where you live, cumin seeds make an acceptable substitute.\n\nThe _panch phoron_ is used like any other _phoron_. You heat up the mustard oil thoroughly, till it starts to smoke lightly and turns pale yellow in colour. You then add as much _panch phoron_ as the recipe calls for to the oil. The spices will start cracking immediately (mostly because of the mustard seeds in the mix) and give out a distinctive, bitter-sweet-anisey aroma. However, watch the _methi_ in the mix carefully; it tends to redden, burn quite easily, and turn bitter.

It is sweet to the taste, flaky, and delicately flavoured. To top it all off, it is also extremely easy to eat, as it contains no bones besides the central skeleton. This recipe, _pabda machh’er tel jhol_, is a delicacy in Bengali cooking. ‘_Tel jhol_’ is the name given to a light curry, which is infused with _kaalo jeere_, green chillies, and mustard oil. Because it is sparsely spiced, this style of curry doesn’t overpower the star ingredient—the fish—but lets it shine on its own.

Smear the cut and cleaned _padba machh_ with ¾ tsp turmeric powder, ¾ tsp salt, and 1 tsp mustard oil. Mix till the fish are well coated, and set aside.\n2. Cut the brinjal into 5-cm segments. We need as many pieces of brinjal as there are fish—in this case, five.\n3. Roughly chop the tomatoes.\n4. Slit the green chillies.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE _BORI_, BRINJAL, AND FISH**\n1. Heat your _kadai_ well and add 35 g mustard oil to the pan.\n2. Once the oil is completely hot (that is, once it has begun to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow), add the _dal’er bori_.\n3. Fry the _boris_ for about 20 seconds till they are golden brown. They colour very quickly, so be alert while frying them.\n4. Remove the _boris_ from the oil and set aside.\n5. Next, add the brinjal pieces to the oil.\n6. Stir-fry for about 4 minutes till they are golden. Remove them from the oil and set aside.\n7. Now, in batches, fry the marinated fish. Fresh, sweetwater fish such as the _pabda_ do not need heavy searing. Fry them lightly to preserve their delicate flavour. A minute on each side should do the job.\n8. Remove the fried fish on a plate and reserve for later use.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING THE _JHOL_**\n1. Before we start, make a paste with 15 g salt, 6 g turmeric powder, and 50 g water. Mix and keep ready.\n2. Heat 7 g mustard oil in the _kadai_. (If the oil that you fried the fish in is not burnt, you may use the same oil to prepare the _jhol_.)\n3. Add the _kaalo jeere_, tomatoes, and 3 green chillies to the oil.\n4. Fry them for a minute on medium heat.\n5. Add the turmeric and salt mixture to the pan, and fry till the water in the spice mix dries up.\n6. Now, pour 400 g of hot water (either heated in an electric kettle or on the stove) into the pan. This will form the curry.\n7. Once the curry starts to simmer, add in the fried _boris_.\n8. Simmer for another 2 minutes before lowering in the _pabda machh_, one by one. Also add the fish drippings that might have collected on the plate that held the fried fish; they are delicious.\n9. Add the fried brinjal to the curry.\n10. Let everything bubble for about 5 minutes. As the curry boils, you will notice that the colour of the _jhol_ has changed from deep yellow to bright yellow. That’s when you know that the turmeric is cooked, and that the curry won’t taste of the raw spice.\n11. Now, pick one of the softened green chillies from the curry onto a small bowl. Add ½ tsp _atta_ to it, along with 1 tbsp of water. Mash the three together, until paste-like.\n12. Add this mixture to the _jhol_. The mashed green chilli will release the heat, while the flour will help the curry thicken and develop body.\n13. Garnish with 2 more slit green chillies, a drizzle of mustard oil (about 7 g), and chopped coriander.\n14. Allow everything to bubble for a couple of more minutes, before turning off the heat.\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n","source":"_posts/pabda-machher-tel-jhol.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Pabda Machh’er Tel Jhol\ntags:\n  - fish\n  - pabda machh\n  - non-vegetarian\ndescription: >-\n  A light, hearty, delicious delicacy, the padba macher tel jhol is packed with\n  the flavours of Bengal’s prized sweetwater pabda fish.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1487900313/pabda-mach-website-thumbnail_hwdrvo.jpg\ncoverImageUrl: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1487900313/pabda-mach-website-thumbnail_hwdrvo.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: AMfGfjhJFNM\ndate: 2017-02-23 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Pabda Machh'er Tel Jhol\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1487900313/pabda-mach-thumbnail-small_ddzr4v.jpg\",\"description\":\"A light, hearty, delicious delicacy, the padba macher tel jhol is packed with the flavours of Bengal’s prized sweetwater pabda fish.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT15M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT30M\",\"recipeYield\":\"5 servings\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"450 g  Pabda machh (cut and cleaned)\",\"35 g  Mustard oil (for frying)\",\"7 g  Mustard oil (for cooking)\",\"7 g  Mustard oil (for garnish)\",\"¼ tsp  Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)\",\"5 pieces  Green chillies (slit)\",\"25 g  Tomato (roughly chopped)\",\"10 pieces  Dal’er bori\",\"100 g  Brinjal (5-cm segments)\",\"15 g (plus ¾ tsp extra for marinating)  Salt\",\"6 g (plus ¾ tsp extra for marinating)  Turmeric powder\",\"½ tsp  Atta (flour)\",\"8 g  Coriander leaves (finely chopped)\",\"400 g  Warm water\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

If you have managed to procure a batch of fresh _pabda_, this should be your go-to _jhol_.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 30 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|                               Quantity | Ingredient                        |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                                  450 g | Pabda machh (cut and cleaned)     |\n|                                   35 g | Mustard oil (for frying)          |\n|                                    7 g | Mustard oil (for cooking)         |\n|                                    7 g | Mustard oil (for garnish)         |\n|                                ¼ tsp   | Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)       |\n|                               5 pieces | Green chillies (slit)             |\n|                                   25 g | Tomato (roughly chopped)          |\n|                              10 pieces | Dal’er bori                       |\n|                                  100 g | Brinjal (5-cm segments)           |\n| 15 g (plus ¾ tsp extra for marinating) | Salt                              |\n|  6 g (plus ¾ tsp extra for marinating) | Turmeric powder                   |\n|                                  ½ tsp | Atta (flour)                      |\n|                                    8 g | Coriander leaves (finely chopped) |\n|                                  400 g | Warm water                        |\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Electric kettle (optional)\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE INGREDIENTS**\n1. Smear the cut and cleaned _padba machh_ with ¾ tsp turmeric powder, ¾ tsp salt, and 1 tsp mustard oil. Mix till the fish are well coated, and set aside.\n2. Cut the brinjal into 5-cm segments. We need as many pieces of brinjal as there are fish—in this case, five.\n3. Roughly chop the tomatoes.\n4. Slit the green chillies.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE _BORI_, BRINJAL, AND FISH**\n1. Heat your _kadai_ well and add 35 g mustard oil to the pan.\n2. Once the oil is completely hot (that is, once it has begun to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow), add the _dal’er bori_.\n3. Fry the _boris_ for about 20 seconds till they are golden brown. They colour very quickly, so be alert while frying them.\n4. Remove the _boris_ from the oil and set aside.\n5. Next, add the brinjal pieces to the oil.\n6. Stir-fry for about 4 minutes till they are golden. Remove them from the oil and set aside.\n7. Now, in batches, fry the marinated fish. Fresh, sweetwater fish such as the _pabda_ do not need heavy searing. Fry them lightly to preserve their delicate flavour. A minute on each side should do the job.\n8. Remove the fried fish on a plate and reserve for later use.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING THE _JHOL_**\n1. Before we start, make a paste with 15 g salt, 6 g turmeric powder, and 50 g water. Mix and keep ready.\n2. Heat 7 g mustard oil in the _kadai_. (If the oil that you fried the fish in is not burnt, you may use the same oil to prepare the _jhol_.)\n3. Add the _kaalo jeere_, tomatoes, and 3 green chillies to the oil.\n4. Fry them for a minute on medium heat.\n5. Add the turmeric and salt mixture to the pan, and fry till the water in the spice mix dries up.\n6. Now, pour 400 g of hot water (either heated in an electric kettle or on the stove) into the pan. This will form the curry.\n7. Once the curry starts to simmer, add in the fried _boris_.\n8. Simmer for another 2 minutes before lowering in the _pabda machh_, one by one. Also add the fish drippings that might have collected on the plate that held the fried fish; they are delicious.\n9. Add the fried brinjal to the curry.\n10. Let everything bubble for about 5 minutes. As the curry boils, you will notice that the colour of the _jhol_ has changed from deep yellow to bright yellow. That’s when you know that the turmeric is cooked, and that the curry won’t taste of the raw spice.\n11. Now, pick one of the softened green chillies from the curry onto a small bowl. Add ½ tsp _atta_ to it, along with 1 tbsp of water. Mash the three together, until paste-like.\n12. Add this mixture to the _jhol_. The mashed green chilli will release the heat, while the flour will help the curry thicken and develop body.\n13. Garnish with 2 more slit green chillies, a drizzle of mustard oil (about 7 g), and chopped coriander.\n14. Allow everything to bubble for a couple of more minutes, before turning off the heat.\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n","slug":"pabda-machher-tel-jhol","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-30T02:29:28.346Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cj7ldrhsm002vtovh1nvp74fn","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A flavourful, light curry with <em>pabda</em> fish</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">It is unbelievable that something with a handful of ingredients can taste so divine.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">T</span>he <em>pabda machh</em> is one of the most beloved of Bengal’s fishes.

Peel and cut the potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin in 4 cm cubes.","2. Divide the borboti, brinjal, and cabbage in segments of 5 cm each.","3. Cut the cauliflower in florets, 5 cm large.","4. In order to cook panchmishali torkari, the vegetables are stir-fried, and the order in which they are added to the pan depends upon their hardness. So, the potatoes and sweet potatoes, which are the hardest of all the veggies, are the first to enter the pan, followed by pumpkin, cauliflower, borboti, and cabbage.

This is not a preparation in which you spice up things with ginger or cumin powder or red chilli powder. The only spice this recipe calls for is a touch of turmeric. Mostly, it relies on the salt and sugar to help draw out the moisture from the vegetables, and allow their flavours to mingle while cooked together. We don’t add water to form a gravy. Rather we cook this _torkari_ on low heat, with the lid on, for nearly 30 to 40 minutes. At the end of this slow cooking process, it reaches a state where no vegetable stands out, yet each has still held on to its flavours and integrity.\n\nComing to the selection of the veggies themselves, some type of starchy item such as a potato or sweet potato is used. These, being otherwise neutral in taste, are the perfect receptacle of the juices from the other vegetables. The mushy texture is usually contributed by pumpkin, while radish is used for the more sharper notes. Some kind of beans (such as _borboti_ or _sheem_) add crunch and colour. In the winter months, cauliflower lends the most sublime flavour to the _torkari_, in addition to providing texture. Finally, slimier vegetables such as brinjals, or cabbage or leafy greens that are prone to wilting on application of heat and salt, coat the mix with their juices and hold everything together.\n\nThere are several versions of _panchmishali torkari_. The choice of _phoron_ (or tempering) will depend on the vegetables used. In this particular recipe, we are using potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_ (yardlong beans), cabbage, and brinjal, with a tempering of _panch phoron_.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 60 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|               Quantity | Ingredient                                |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **OIL**                |                                           |\n|                   40 g | Mustard oil                               |\n| **TEMPERING (PHORON)** |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Bay leaves (whole)                        |\n|               2 pieces | Dried red chillies (whole)                |\n|                1 piece | Green chilli (slit)                       |\n|                  1 tsp | Panch phoron                              |\n| **THE VEGETABLES**     |                                           |\n|                  100 g | Brinjals (5-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  200 g | Potatoes (4-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  100 g | Sweet potatoes (4-cm cubes)               |\n|                  200 g | Pumpkin (4-cm cubes)                      |\n|                  200 g | Cauliflower (5-cm florets)                |\n|                  100 g | Borboti or yardlong beans (5-cm segments) |\n|                  100 g | Cabbage (5-cm segments)                   |\n| **THE SEASONING**      |                                           |\n|                  ½ tsp | Turmeric powder                           |\n|                   12 g | Salt                                      |\n|                   25 g | Sugar                                     |\n| **THE GARNISH**        |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Green chillies (slit)                     |\n|                   10 g | Coriander leaves (chopped)                |\n|                  ½ tsp | Bhaja masala                              |\n|                    5 g | Ghee                                      |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- Lid for the cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Peel and cut the potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin in 4 cm cubes.\n2. Cut the _borboti_, brinjal, and cabbage in segments of 5 cm each.\n3. Cut the cauliflower in florets, 5 cm large.\n4. In order to cook _panchmishali torkari_, the vegetables are stir-fried, and the order in which they are added to the pan depends upon their hardness. So, the potatoes and sweet potatoes, which are the hardest of all the veggies, are the first to enter the pan, followed by pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_, and cabbage. We deal with the brinjals separately, as explained in the next step.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Heat mustard oil in a pan till it starts to smoke lightly and the pungent smell is gone.\n2. Keeping the pan on medium heat, add in the brinjals and fry them for about 3 minutes till they are golden.\n3. Remove them from pan and reserve for later use. Frying the brinjals separately enhances their flavour.\n4. Now, in the same oil, add the tempering of dried red chillies, bay leaves, green chilli, and _panch phoron_. _Panch phoron_ is a mix of the following whole spices in equal proportion: fenugreek seeds (_methi_), fennel seeds (_mouri_), mustard seeds (_shorshe_), nigella seeds (_kaalo jeere_), and a typically Bengali spice called _radhuni_.\n5. Once the spices start to crackle, add in the potatoes and sweet potatoes to the oil.\n6. Fry these for about 3 minutes before introducing the next vegetable, that is, pumpkin.\n7. Fry the pumpkin, sweet potatoes, and potatoes together for another 3 minutes before adding the cauliflower. Basically, at intervals of 3 minutes, we add the next vegetable and stir-fry it together with the veggies already in the pan.\n8. Once the cauliflower is fried, add the _borboti_, and then, after 3 minutes, the cabbage.\n\n**STEP III—STEAMING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Once all the veggies have been fried, add in the salt and turmeric, and stir them in.\n2. At this point, lower the heat and cover the pan with a lid. The salt will help release the moisture from the vegetables, and gently steaming them with the lid on will help soften them up.\n3. Cook the vegetables like this for about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan. While doing so, be gentle, as the we don’t want the vegetables to turn into mush. (Always use a folding motion to stir the veggies around.)\n4. After 15 minutes, add the sugar and the fried brinjals, and cover and cook for another 10 minutes or so, stirring occasionally.\n5. You will know that the _torkari_ is done when the vegetables are completely tender and have integrated themselves into the dish, but still have the integrity to not fall apart to the touch.\n6. At this point, garnish with the chopped coriander leaves, green chillies, _bhaja masala_, and _ghee_.\n7. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and allow it to rest for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | Roti\n","source":"_posts/panchmishali-torkari.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Panchmishali Torkari\ndescription: Video recipe of authentic, vegetarian Bengali dish of cauliflower, beans, sweet potatoes, eggplants, cooked with panch phoron tempering.\ntags:\n  - vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\n  - torkari\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1485389957/website-thumbnail-panchmishalitorkari_t7jruj.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: DWY8qtUC9K0\ndate: 2017-01-26 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Panchmishali Torkari\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1485389957/thumbnail-small-panchmishalitorkari_pexgac.jpg\",\"description\":\"Panchmishali torkari is any Bengali mixed-vegetable preparation, in which the vegetables are first stir-fried and then steamed in their own juices till they are tender and well-integrated.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT20M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT60M\",\"recipeYield\":\"5 servings\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"40 g  Mustard oil\",\"2 pieces  Bay leaves (whole)\",\"2 pieces  Dried red chillies (whole)\",\"1 piece  Green chilli (slit)\",\"1 tsp  Panch phoron\",\"100 g  Brinjals (5-cm cubes)\",\"200 g  Potatoes (4-cm cubes)\",\"100 g  Sweet potatoes (4-cm cubes)\",\"200 g  Pumpkin (4-cm cubes)\",\"200 g  Cauliflower (5-cm florets)\",\"100 g  Borboti or yardlong beans (5-cm segments)\",\"100 g  Cabbage (5-cm segments)\",\"½ tsp  Turmeric powder\",\"12 g  Salt\",\"25 g  Sugar\",\"2 pieces  Green chillies (slit)\",\"10 g  Coriander leaves (chopped)\",\"½ tsp  Bhaja masala\",\"5 g  Ghee\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

Mostly, it relies on the salt and sugar to help draw out the moisture from the vegetables, and allow their flavours to mingle while cooked together. We don’t add water to form a gravy. Rather we cook this _torkari_ on low heat, with the lid on, for nearly 30 to 40 minutes. At the end of this slow cooking process, it reaches a state where no vegetable stands out, yet each has still held on to its flavours and integrity.\n\nComing to the selection of the veggies themselves, some type of starchy item such as a potato or sweet potato is used. These, being otherwise neutral in taste, are the perfect receptacle of the juices from the other vegetables. The mushy texture is usually contributed by pumpkin, while radish is used for the more sharper notes. Some kind of beans (such as _borboti_ or _sheem_) add crunch and colour.

This is not a preparation in which you spice up things with ginger or cumin powder or red chilli powder. The only spice this recipe calls for is a touch of turmeric. Mostly, it relies on the salt and sugar to help draw out the moisture from the vegetables, and allow their flavours to mingle while cooked together. We don’t add water to form a gravy. Rather we cook this <em>torkari</em> on low heat, with the lid on, for nearly 30 to 40 minutes. At the end of this slow cooking process, it reaches a state where no vegetable stands out, yet each has still held on to its flavours and integrity.</p>\n<p>Coming to the selection of the veggies themselves, some type of starchy item such as a potato or sweet potato is used. These, being otherwise neutral in taste, are the perfect receptacle of the juices from the other vegetables. The mushy texture is usually contributed by pumpkin, while radish is used for the more sharper notes. Some kind of beans (such as <em>borboti</em> or <em>sheem</em>) add crunch and colour. In the winter months, cauliflower lends the most sublime flavour to the <em>torkari</em>, in addition to providing texture. Finally, slimier vegetables such as brinjals, or cabbage or leafy greens that are prone to wilting on application of heat and salt, coat the mix with their juices and hold everything together.</p>\n<p>There are several versions of <em>panchmishali torkari</em>. The choice of <em>phoron</em> (or tempering) will depend on the vegetables used. In this particular recipe, we are using potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, cauliflower, <em>borboti</em> (yardlong beans), cabbage, and brinjal, with a tempering of <em>panch phoron</em>.<br></p></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 60 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 5 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>OIL</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>40 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>TEMPERING (PHORON)</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 pieces</td>\n<td>Bay leaves (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 pieces</td>\n<td>Dried red chillies (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 piece</td>\n<td>Green chilli (slit)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 tsp</td>\n<td>Panch phoron</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>THE VEGETABLES</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g</td>\n<td>Brinjals (5-cm cubes)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>200 g</td>\n<td>Potatoes (4-cm cubes)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g</td>\n<td>Sweet potatoes (4-cm cubes)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>200 g</td>\n<td>Pumpkin (4-cm cubes)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>200 g</td>\n<td>Cauliflower (5-cm florets)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g</td>\n<td>Borboti or yardlong beans (5-cm segments)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g</td>\n<td>Cabbage (5-cm segments)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>THE SEASONING</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n<td>Turmeric powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>THE GARNISH</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 pieces</td>\n<td>Green chillies (slit)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Coriander leaves (chopped)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n<td>Bhaja masala</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Ghee</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan</li>\n<li>Lid for the cooking vessel</li>\n<li><em>Khunti</em> | long spatula</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><p><strong>STEP I—PREPPING THE VEGETABLES</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Peel and cut the potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin in 4 cm cubes.</li>\n<li>Cut the <em>borboti</em>, brinjal, and cabbage in segments of 5 cm each.</li>\n<li>Cut the cauliflower in florets, 5 cm large.</li>\n<li>In order to cook <em>panchmishali torkari</em>, the vegetables are stir-fried, and the order in which they are added to the pan depends upon their hardness.

On those distraught Sunday evenings when you cannot bring yourself to face the hard truth of going back to work the next morning, spend 20 minutes making this simple <em>mosur</em> dal. As the dal is boiling, start cooking some rice. While you are at it, throw in a small potato (halved) into the pot of rice. At the end of those 20 minutes you will have steamed rice, dal, and alu sheddho. Make yourself a hot omelette, if you care. Squeeze a dash of lime on your dal.

In this recipe, we show you how to make the version with <em>kheer</em>.<br></p></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 3 hours<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 16–17 <em>patishaptas</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><p><strong>FOR THE CRÊPE</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>75 g</td>\n<td>Maida (flour)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30 g</td>\n<td>Sooji (semolina)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Rice grains</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>280 g</td>\n<td>Milk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Ghee (for greasing)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>FOR THE <em>KHEER</em> (FILLING)</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1.5 kg</td>\n<td>Milk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>65 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 tsp</td>\n<td>Maida (flour)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Mixing bowl (for the crêpes)</li>\n<li>Balloon whisk | fork (for the crêpes)</li>\n<li>Ladle (for the crêpes)</li>\n<li>Non-stick pan | <em>appam chatti</em> (for the crêpes)</li>\n<li>Long spatula | <em>khunti</em> (for the crêpes)</li>\n<li>Heavy-bottom saucepan | boiling pot (for the <em>kheer</em>)</li>\n<li>Wooden spoon (for the <em>kheer</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Grinder</li>\n<li>Stove</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><p><strong>STEP I—MAKE THE CRÊPE BATTER</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add the rice grains to an electric grinder and blitz them to a fine powder. You now have rice flour.</li>\n<li>In a mixing bowl, add the <em>maida</em> (75 g), <em>sooji</em> (30 g), rice flour (10 g), sugar (30 g), salt (¼ tsp), and milk (280 g).</li>\n<li>Mix the ingredients together till they are more or less combined. Do not over-mix or your crêpes may turn out chewy.</li>\n<li>Cover the batter and set it aside to rest, for 2 hours.

[Note that we are cooking only one side of the crêpe.]</li>\n<li>Transfer the <em>patishapta</em> from the pan to a plate and proceed making the rest.

The reason this dish occupies a special position on wedding menus is because the tender, flaky, pieces of sweetwater carp make for delicious and easy consumption. _Biyebari’r machh bhaja_ is characterised by an extra-crunchy exterior, one that almost crackles when broken into.

Place the fish in a mixing dish, and add the salt, turmeric powder, arrowroot powder, and corn flour.\n3. Coat the fish pieces well. The arrowroot powder and corn flour in the marinade will absorb any remaining moisture, and allow the crust to turn golden when fried.\n3. Heat 4-cm-deep mustard oil in a _kadai_ till it starts to smoke and changes colour to a pale yellow. The frying temperature for this recipe is 180°C.\n4. Gently lower the fish in the oil, skin side down. Make sure that the fish pieces are not piled one on top of the other, but placed side by side in oil. Also, do not overcrowd the pan (frying them two at a time should suffice), as we want the oil to freely flow around the fish.\n5. Once the skin-side is golden (this should take about 6 minutes), turn the fish over to its flesh side. Fry this side for another 3 minutes.\n6.

While producing good _kababs_ generally requires special grilling, charring or _tandoori_ techniques, _shami kabab_ can be easily prepared at home with no special equipment. Popular on the Indian subcontinent, this snack resembles a pan-fried, ground-meat patty. It is best made with a lean, boneless red meat of your choice (mutton, beef, lamb, etc.). It is important that the meat has a low fat but high muscle content. Fat within the meat tends to melt the kabab when it is fried, while we want it to hold itself together. More muscle and fibre, on the other hand, will ensure that the meat has some texture when it is ground, providing a satisfying resistance with each bite. The use of _chhola’r dal_ (split Bengal gram) adds nuttiness. Besides that, the other flavours come from chopped mint leaves, green chillies, _garam masala_, and ghee. We use a beaten egg to bind everything together. Depending on the recipe, such kababs may sometimes be coated in eggs or bread crumbs before they are fried. We, however, fry them directly so that the meat itself forms a rich, brown, caramelised crust.  \n\n\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 2 hours   \n**YIELDS** 16–17 kababs\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n\n| Quantity | Ingredient                            | \n|----------|---------------------------------------|\n|     1 kg | Boneless mutton or beef (lean)        |\n|    200 g | Chhola’r dal (split Bengal gram)      |\n|    100 g | Onions                                |\n|     30 g | Ginger                                |\n|     20 g | Garlic                                |\n|    4 pcs | Bay leaves                            |\n|    8 pcs | Dried red chillies                    |\n|     16 g | Green chillies                        |\n|     10 g | Mint leaves                           |\n|     30 g | Raisins                               |\n|     10 g | Lime juice                            |\n|      4 g | [Shahi garam masala](recipe/shahi-garam-masala/)                    |\n|      5 g | Ghee                                  |\n|        1 | Beaten egg                            |\n|       20 | Salt                                  |\n|  ~ 200 g | Vegetable oil (1-cm deep, for frying) |\n\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot\n- Flat frying pan | skillet\n-  _Jhhajhhri_ | perforated frying spoon\n- _Jhuri_ | draining rack | colander \n\n\n## Method\n\n1.

While producing good _kababs_ generally requires special grilling, charring or _tandoori_ techniques, _shami kabab_ can be easily prepared at home with no special equipment. Popular on the Indian subcontinent, this snack resembles a pan-fried, ground-meat patty. It is best made with a lean, boneless red meat of your choice (mutton, beef, lamb, etc.). It is important that the meat has a low fat but high muscle content. Fat within the meat tends to melt the kabab when it is fried, while we want it to hold itself together. More muscle and fibre, on the other hand, will ensure that the meat has some texture when it is ground, providing a satisfying resistance with each bite. The use of _chhola’r dal_ (split Bengal gram) adds nuttiness. Besides that, the other flavours come from chopped mint leaves, green chillies, _garam masala_, and ghee. We use a beaten egg to bind everything together. Depending on the recipe, such kababs may sometimes be coated in eggs or bread crumbs before they are fried.

Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city. Make these at home, or hunt them down from the source—irrespective of how you get your hands on these items, we hope you enjoy them._]\n\n<span class=\"dropcap\">T</span>ingmo or ting momo is one of those breads that is extremely satisfying to get right. The distinguishing feature of this steamed dumpling is its layered appearance. Once properly proofed and steamed, all the layers of the bun seem to open up like a flower. In this recipe, we show you how to knead, roll, and shape the dough in order to get a perfect tingmo. \n<hr>\n**A note on the yeast:** Yeast will need to be used depending on its type. Check the box/packaging to determine whether yours is an ‘instant’ yeast, ‘active dry’ yeast, or ‘fresh’ yeast. **Instant yeast** doesn’t need to be separately activated. It can be mixed directly into the flour and kneaded along with the other ingredients. **Active dry yeast** and **fresh yeast** need to be activated before they can be added to the flour. To do that, disperse the yeast in lukewarm water (in this case, about 145 g) along with the sugar (10 g). Cover and set aside for about 15 minutes, at the end of which, if your yeast is active, the mixture should take on a frothy appearance. Add this mixture to the flour and proceed as instructed. \n \n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 2 hours\n**YIELDS** 4 tingmos\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                   |\n|----------|------------------------------|\n|    250 g | Maida (flour)                |\n|      5 g | Salt                         |\n|     10 g | Sugar                        |\n|      3 g | Dry instant yeast            |\n|    145 g | Warm water                   |\n|   2 tbsp | Vegetable oil (for greasing) |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Rolling pin\n- Steamer\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1.

Check the box/packaging to determine whether yours is an ‘instant’ yeast, ‘active dry’ yeast, or ‘fresh’ yeast. **Instant yeast** doesn’t need to be separately activated. It can be mixed directly into the flour and kneaded along with the other ingredients. **Active dry yeast** and **fresh yeast** need to be activated before they can be added to the flour. To do that, disperse the yeast in lukewarm water (in this case, about 145 g) along with the sugar (10 g). Cover and set aside for about 15 minutes, at the end of which, if your yeast is active, the mixture should take on a frothy appearance.

Once the ingredients have come together, transfer the dough to the work surface. \n2. Knead the dough for 15 minutes, repeatedly folding the dough over itself to develop gluten. Round the dough by tucking all the edges at the bottom and return it to the mixing bowl, now greased with oil, to prevent the dough from sticking.\n3. Cover and proof the dough in a warm place for 1 hour, until the dough doubles in size.\n4. Dust the work surface with flour and transfer the dough to it. Flatten the dough into a rectangle with your palms. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a thin sheet, 40 cm by 45 cm in dimensions, maintaining its rectangular shape as much as possible. \n5. Apply oil on the sheet and fold its longer side into thirds. \n6. Use a knife to divide the folded dough into four equal parts. Divide each quarter further into 6 long strips. \n7.
