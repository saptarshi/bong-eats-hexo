Home kitchens have undoubtedly devised healthier ways of dishing out this family favourite. Not only are these _porotas_ satisfyingly delicious when served piping hot right off the skillet, they also make for extraordinarily good packed meals. Ideal for school or work tiffin boxes or long train journeys, soft _alu porotas_ need few accompaniments besides some chilled yoghurt and hot, tangy _achar_.\n\nA good stuffed _porota_ has a flaky exterior (you should be able to tear it with one hand) and a generous amount of well-spiced filling. Moreover, the filling should be evenly distributed within the _porota_ so you get some with every bite. In this recipe, we take you step-by-step through the process of creating soft, well-balanced _porotas_.\n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 45 minutes\n**YIELDS** 4 parathas\n**CALORIES** 385 kcal per paratha\n***\n## Ingredients\n|            Quantity | Ingredient                                     |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n|   **FOR THE DOUGH** |                                                |\n|               150 g | Atta (whole wheat flour)                       |\n|                 3 g | Salt                                           |\n|                 7 g | Sugar                                          |\n|                 8 g | Oil                                            |\n|           100–110 g | Hot water                                      |\n| **FOR THE FILLING** |                                                |\n|               250 g | Potatoes (boiled and peeled)                   |\n|                80 g | Onions (finely chopped)                        |\n|                15 g | Ginger (minced)                                |\n|                10 g | Garlic (minced)                                |\n|                 5 g | Green chillies (chopped)                       |\n|                 5 g | Kasuri methi/curry leaves/coriander leaves     |\n|                 5 g | Salt                                           |\n|               ½ tsp | Chaat masala                                   |\n|               1 tsp | Bhaja masala                                   |\n|               ¼ tsp | Jowan (carom seeds)                            |\n|               100 g | Oil for cooking/frying                         |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Steamer | boiling pot\n- Rolling pin\n- Skillet | _tawa_\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n- Napkin | paper towel (optional)\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Steamer\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—MIX THE DOUGH**\n1. Add _atta_, salt, sugar, and oil to a mixing bowl. Mix to distribute the oil evenly among the other ingredients.\n2. Add the water. Use hot water for soft _porotas_.\n3. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes. It may seem tacky at the outset, but keep going. The dough should be soft and pliable so that it can hold a generous amount of filling.\n4. Once the kneading is done, cover and rest the dough for about 30 minutes.   \n\n**STEP II—PREPARE THE FILLING**\n1. Meanwhile, halve or quarter your potatoes (depending on their size) and steam them till they are tender. This should take about 20 minutes. Steaming ensures that the potatoes do not overcook or absorb any excess moisture from sitting in a pot of boiling water. The drier the filling, the easier it is to stuff the _porota_ without any leakage.\n2. Peel the potatoes and mash them while they are still hot to allow all the steam to escape. This will further ensure that the filling remains dry.\n3. Finely chop the onions, ginger, garlic, and green chillies. Tear or roughly chop the curry or coriander leaves, whichever you are using.\n4. Heat 7 g vegetable oil in a skillet. Add the onions and fry them for about 4 to 5 minutes till they turn brown. \n5. Add the ginger and green chillies, and fry for another minute or so before adding the garlic and curry leaves/_kasuri methi_/coriander leaves. Do not cook the garlic too much; turn off the heat 30 seconds after adding it to the pan.\n6. Transfer this mixture from the pan on to the mashed potatoes. Also add the salt, _chaat masala_, _bhaja masala_, and _jowan_.\n7. Give everything a good mix until the filling is uniform. \n\n**STEP III—STUFF, ROLL, FRY**\n1. Divide the filling into four equal parts (each should weigh about 75 g). Give the dough a quick knead and divide it into four equal portions too (about 70 g each). Form each portion of the filling and dough into a neat ball and keep at the ready.\n2. Using your hands, flatten a ball of dough until it has stretched to a diameter of 8 cm. Place a ball of the filling in the centre. \n3. Bring the sides of the dough towards one another. The idea is to completely enclose the filling with the dough. Pinch the gathered sides to seal the package.\n4. Coat the dough with some flour and place it on the workstation in front of you. Press down gently to flatten the dough and distribute the filling evenly within it.\n5. Using a rolling pin, start rolling in two short, gentle strokes. Rotate 90 degrees between each set of strokes. Keep doing this until the _porota_ is about 18 cm in diameter. Be sure to roll at the edges and not at the centre. This will ensure that the _porota_ is of a uniform thickness throughout. \n6. In a skillet set on medium heat, add 1 tbsp of oil. Once hot, lay the _porota_ flat on it. Wait for a minute and apply 1 tsp of oil to the top. Flip the _porota_.\n7. Keep flipping every minute until the _porota_ is an even, golden colour on both sides. \n8. Remove from the skillet and serve hot.\n\n\n\n## Served with\n- Yoghurt\n- Pickles\n- Green chilli\n- Raw onion","source":"_posts/aloo-paratha.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Aloo Paratha\ntags:\n  - snack\n  - vegetarian\n  - vegan\n  - paratha\ndescription: >-\n  Alu porota or ‘paratha’ needs no introduction.

Add _atta_, salt, sugar, and oil to a mixing bowl. Mix to distribute the oil evenly among the other ingredients.\n2. Add the water. Use hot water for soft _porotas_.\n3. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes. It may seem tacky at the outset, but keep going. The dough should be soft and pliable so that it can hold a generous amount of filling.\n4. Once the kneading is done, cover and rest the dough for about 30 minutes.   \n\n**STEP II—PREPARE THE FILLING**\n1. Meanwhile, halve or quarter your potatoes (depending on their size) and steam them till they are tender. This should take about 20 minutes. Steaming ensures that the potatoes do not overcook or absorb any excess moisture from sitting in a pot of boiling water. The drier the filling, the easier it is to stuff the _porota_ without any leakage.\n2. Peel the potatoes and mash them while they are still hot to allow all the steam to escape. This will further ensure that the filling remains dry.\n3. Finely chop the onions, ginger, garlic, and green chillies. Tear or roughly chop the curry or coriander leaves, whichever you are using.\n4. Heat 7 g vegetable oil in a skillet. Add the onions and fry them for about 4 to 5 minutes till they turn brown. \n5. Add the ginger and green chillies, and fry for another minute or so before adding the garlic and curry leaves/_kasuri methi_/coriander leaves. Do not cook the garlic too much; turn off the heat 30 seconds after adding it to the pan.\n6. Transfer this mixture from the pan on to the mashed potatoes. Also add the salt, _chaat masala_, _bhaja masala_, and _jowan_.\n7. Give everything a good mix until the filling is uniform. \n\n**STEP III—STUFF, ROLL, FRY**\n1. Divide the filling into four equal parts (each should weigh about 75 g). Give the dough a quick knead and divide it into four equal portions too (about 70 g each). Form each portion of the filling and dough into a neat ball and keep at the ready.\n2. Using your hands, flatten a ball of dough until it has stretched to a diameter of 8 cm. Place a ball of the filling in the centre. \n3. Bring the sides of the dough towards one another. The idea is to completely enclose the filling with the dough. Pinch the gathered sides to seal the package.\n4. Coat the dough with some flour and place it on the workstation in front of you. Press down gently to flatten the dough and distribute the filling evenly within it.\n5. Using a rolling pin, start rolling in two short, gentle strokes. Rotate 90 degrees between each set of strokes. Keep doing this until the _porota_ is about 18 cm in diameter. Be sure to roll at the edges and not at the centre. This will ensure that the _porota_ is of a uniform thickness throughout. \n6. In a skillet set on medium heat, add 1 tbsp of oil. Once hot, lay the _porota_ flat on it. Wait for a minute and apply 1 tsp of oil to the top. Flip the _porota_.\n7. Keep flipping every minute until the _porota_ is an even, golden colour on both sides. \n8. Remove from the skillet and serve hot.\n\n\n\n## Served with\n- Yoghurt\n- Pickles\n- Green chilli\n- Raw onion","slug":"aloo-paratha","published":1,"updated":"2017-09-01T02:56:10.452Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjqrmmt2r0003yovhzv0owvmp","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A pan-fried flatbread stuffed with a filling of mashed potatoes</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">In this recipe, we take you through the process of mixing, stuffing, rolling, and frying the perfect ‘parathas’.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">A</span>lu porota or ‘alu paratha’ is wildly popular all over South Asia—no <em>dhaba</em> scene is complete without the sight of hot parathas with melting butter on top.

Grease the pudding dish with butter.\n2. Using a foil and a baking paper create the lid for the pudding basin. Don't forget to create a pleat to allow the pudding to rise. Follow the video to see how. Grease the bottom side (the baking paper) with butter.\n3. Cut a baking paper to the shape of the bottom of your pudding basin. Line your pudding mould with the paper.\n4. Sift together the plain flour (maida), baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl.\n5. Zest the two large lemons. Don't get to the white pith—it is bitter!\n6. Peel and grate the carrots.\n7. Chop the candied ginger into small 5mm pieces.\n8. Grind fresh ginger with twice the weight of water. You will need 50 grams of this paste for this recipe.\n9. In another mixing bowl whisk the room-temperature butter till it is soft.\n10. Add the brown sugar and whisk until pale and airy.\n11. Whisk in three eggs one at a time, taking care to mix one in thoroughly before adding the next.\n12. Now add the flavouring agents—lemon zest, gorom moshla, and ginger paste to the mixture.\n13. Squeeze the juice of one large lemon into the mix and whisk everything together. Now put the whisk away. We won't be using it anymore.\n14. Bring a kettle of water to boil. We will need this water to steam the pudding.\n15. Next add the dry-ingredients mixture, grated carrots, and candied ginger to the wet mixture. Fold gently with a spatula to mix everything evenly. Don't over-mix so as to not develop too much gluten.\n16. The pudding batter can now be poured into the buttered and lined mould.\n17. Cover the pudding basin with the pleated foil-baking paper lid. Tie a strong cotton twine all around below the lip of the basin. Now use another twine to create a sling. Watch the video to see how this is done.\n18. Pour the boiling water into a large pot placed on the stove. Lower the pudding basin into the boiling water using the sling for safety. Pour more boiling water into the pot to bring the water upto two-third of the height of the basin.\n19. Cover with a fitted lid and let this simmer on the stovetop. Make sure to refill with more water if the water level goes down a lot.\n20. After 1 hour 45 minutes take out the pudding basin using the sling. Uncover the lid and let it cool for two hours. Serve while still a little warm.","source":"_drafts/steamed-carrot-ginger-pudding.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Steamed Carrot & Ginger Pudding\ntags:\n- anglo indian recipe\n- dessert\n- pudding\n- christmas\n- steamed\n\ndescription: >-\n  Anglo-Indian steamed cake with ginger, served with a tea-infused crème anglaise.

The idea of a ginger pudding with a tea sauce sounded perfect, and to our surprise it really works!</p>\n<p>Steamed puddings are traditionally made in pudding basins, which are made of metal or ceramic. Some have lids and some—like the one we are using—need to be covered with a foil and baking paper with a pleat that allows the pudding to expand. It also has a lip which lets you tie a string around it and create a sling with which the pudding pot can be safely lowered into and retrieved from the pot of boiling water. </p>\n<p>If you enjoy the history of food and are not afraid to try something new you should try this recipe. </p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 3 hours<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 1 pudding (6 servings)</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR PUDDING</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>115 g</td>\n<td>Salted butter (softened)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>175 g</td>\n<td>Brown sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Eggs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 large</td>\n<td>Lemons (juice of 1, zest of 2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Gorom moshla</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50 g</td>\n<td>Fresh ginger paste</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>120 g</td>\n<td>Plain flour (maida)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n<td>Baking soda</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n<td>Baking powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g</td>\n<td>Carrot (grated)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g</td>\n<td>Candied ginger (5mm pieces)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR THE TEA CUSTARD</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>150 g</td>\n<td>Milk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pc</td>\n<td>Cardamom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Ginger (sliced)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Tea</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Egg yolks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>250 g</td>\n<td>Heavy cream</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ cup</td>\n<td>Brandy (optional; for flambé)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Pudding basin or a thick ceramic bowl</li>\n<li>Cotton twine</li>\n<li>Aluminium foil</li>\n<li>Baking paper</li>\n<li>Balloon whisk</li>\n<li>Mixing bowl</li>\n<li>Frying pan</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n<li>Weighing scale</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><h3 id=\"Making-the-pudding\"><a href=\"#Making-the-pudding\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Making the pudding\"></a>Making the pudding</h3><ol>\n<li>Grease the pudding dish with butter.</li>\n<li>Using a foil and a baking paper create the lid for the pudding basin.

This category is called the ‘bhorta’, and is admittedly more popular within the Bangladeshi branches of Bengali cooking than it is within the West Bengal ones. The mode of preparation is so simplistic—requiring only a handful of basic, affordable ingredients, and very little effort—that every cuisine has its take on the bhorta in some form or another (the Bihari aloo chokha, Bengali aloo sheddho or aloo bhaate, and the North Indian aloo/baingan/chicken bharta come to mind).\n\nSo an aloo bhorta, as you may have guessed, is a mash of boiled potatoes, and fried onions, garlic, and chillies. In this recipe, we’ve used both dried red chillies and green chillies, as well as some raw mustard oil for an added kick. Although this preparation doesn’t really warrant a recipe, no compendium of Bengali cooking would be complete without this quintessential comfort food. The next time you are tempted to reach for the take-out menu after a busy work day, be sure to remember to put together a simple meal of steaming hot rice, dal, and the simple aloo bhorta.\n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 20 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 4 servings\n**CALORIES** 73 kcal per serving\n***\n\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient         | \n|----------|--------------------|\n|    250 g | Potatoes           |\n|     50 g | Onions             |\n|      5 g | Garlic             |\n|    2 pcs | Green chillies     |\n|    2 pcs | Dried red chillies |\n|      4 g | Salt               |\n|      8 g | Mustard oil        |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Steamer | boiling pot | saucepan\n- Small frying pan\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n\n1.

There are five important points to remember while cooking this dish—(1) The cabbage must be cut as finely as possible. Larger strips will not only take longer to cook, they will fail to give the _badhakopi'r ghonto_ the desired texture; (2) Once you add the cabbage to the pan, don’t add any extra water; (3) Cook on low heat. This will ensure that the moisture extracted from the cabbage doesn't evaporate too quickly and cause the cabbage to stick to the pan; (4) Always cover the pan with a lid. This will also prevent the moisture generated by the cabbage from evaporating too quickly; (5) Stir intermittently to prevent sticking.\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 45 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 6 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|       Quantity | Ingredient                               |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------|\n|           15 g | Mustard oil                              |\n|        1 piece | Dried red chilli (whole)                 |\n|        1 piece | Bay leaf (whole)                         |\n|        1 piece | Cardamom (whole)                         |\n|        1 piece | Clove (whole)                            |\n|        1 piece | Cinnamon (whole)                         |\n| 2 g (or ¼ tsp) | Cumin seeds                              |\n|          400 g | Cabbage (cut into thin shreds, 2 mm wide)|\n|          100 g | Potatoes (diced; 3 cm cubes)             |\n|           50 g | Peas (shelled)                           |\n|           30 g | Tomatoes (diced)                         |\n|           75 g | Prawns (optional; shelled and deveined)  |\n|           20 g | Ginger paste                             |\n|            2 g | Cumin powder                             |\n|            1 g | Coriander powder                         |\n|            3 g | Turmeric powder                          |\n|            1 g | Red chilli powder                        |\n|           10 g | Salt                                     |\n|           25 g | Sugar                                    |\n|            4 g | Ghee                                     |\n|          ¼ tsp | Garam masala powder                      |\n|       2 pieces | Green chillies (slit)                    |\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | wok\n- Lid for cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**PART I—CUTTING THE CABBAGE**\n1. Cut the cabbage into the thinnest possible shreds that you can manage. To make this process easier, deal with the vegetable in sections of 5 cm each. Take a segment, one at a time, and shave off shreds along its cross-section with your knife. Take your time with the cutting, because the outcome of the dish will depend on this step. [Watch this video, which shows you how to cut cabbage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3EUuW5S7s) for _badhakopi'r ghonto_.\n\n**PART II—TEMPERING THE OIL (_PHORON_)**\n2. Heat 15 g mustard oil in a pan till it begins to smoke.\n3. Add the _phoron_ (comprising the dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and cumin seeds) to the oil.\n4. Once the spices start crackling, add in the cubed potatoes.\n5. Fry the potatoes for 3 minutes on low heat, with the lid on.\n\n**PART III—SAUTEEING THE SPICES**\n6. Make a paste by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and 80 g of water.\n7. Add this mixture to the potatoes and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n8. Add in the diced tomatoes and shelled peas.\n9. Then, add another 80 g of water and sautee the spices till the water dries off.\n10. Add a slit green chilli and cook with the lid on for another minute.\n\n**PART IV—STEAMING THE CABBAGE**\n11. Add the shredded cabbage to the pan, along with the salt.\n12. Fold in the spices and cook on low heat with the lid on. The salt will start dehydrating the cabbage and drawing out its moisture.\n13. Steam the cabbage on low heat, with the lid on, for 12 minutes, stirring intermittently. Keep an eye on the pan to ensure that the cabbage doesn’t stick to the bottom.\n14. Add the sugar and cook for another 15 minutes, stirring intermittently. The sugar will soon start to caramelise. Be sure to scrape down and integrate the lightly browned bits of the _torkari_ that stick to the bottom of your pan (they are yummy!).\n15. This step is optional. You can coat a couple of cleaned prawns in a pinch of salt and turmeric powder, and fry in a separate pan for 30 seconds on each side. Chop the fried prawns in chunks of 1 cm, and add to the _ghonto_.\n16. Garnish with _ghee_, powdered _garam masala_, and a  slit green chilli.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | roti\n","source":"_posts/badhakopir-ghonto.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Badhakopi’r Ghonto | Dry Cabbage and Peas Curry\ndescription: A mildly spiced dry cabbage curry with peas-a kind of Bengali vegetarian ghonto with delicate flavours of ginger, garam masala and ghee.\ntags:\n  - ghonto\n  - torkari\n  - vegetarian\n  - vegan\n  - gluten-free\n  - cabbage\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1479339208/badhakopir-ghonto_thumbnail_c7ocub.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: nmkY-fGFTuY\ndate: 2016-12-01 20:30:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Badhakopi'r ghonto\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1479339208/badhakopir-ghonto_cover-small_uif59l.jpg\",\"description\":\"This is a beautifully spiced cabbage and peas preparation that is hot, sweet, and with hints of ginger, ghee, and garam masala.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT10M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT45M\",\"recipeYield\":\"4\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"Mustard oil (for cooking) 15 g\",\"Dried red chillies 1 piece\",\"Bay leaves 1 piece\",\"Cardamom 1 piece\",\"Cloves 1 piece\",\"Cinnamon 1 piece\",\"Cumin seeds 2 g (or ¼ tsp)\",\"Cabbage 400 g\",\"Potatoes 100 g\",\"Peas 50 g\",\"Tomatoes 30 g\",\"Prawns (optional) 75 g\",\"Ginger paste 20 g\",\"Cumin powder 2 g\",\"Coriander powder 1 g\",\"Turmeric powder 3 g\",\"Red chilli powder 1 g\",\"Salt 10 g\",\"Sugar 25 g\",\"Ghee 4 g\",\"Garam masala ¼ tsp\",\"Green chillies 2 g (or 2 pieces)\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1 Cut the cabbage into the thinnest possible shreds that you can manage.

Cut the cabbage into the thinnest possible shreds that you can manage. To make this process easier, deal with the vegetable in sections of 5 cm each. Take a segment, one at a time, and shave off shreds along its cross-section with your knife. Take your time with the cutting, because the outcome of the dish will depend on this step. [Watch this video, which shows you how to cut cabbage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3EUuW5S7s) for _badhakopi'r ghonto_.\n\n**PART II—TEMPERING THE OIL (_PHORON_)**\n2. Heat 15 g mustard oil in a pan till it begins to smoke.\n3. Add the _phoron_ (comprising the dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and cumin seeds) to the oil.\n4. Once the spices start crackling, add in the cubed potatoes.\n5. Fry the potatoes for 3 minutes on low heat, with the lid on.\n\n**PART III—SAUTEEING THE SPICES**\n6. Make a paste by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and 80 g of water.\n7. Add this mixture to the potatoes and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n8. Add in the diced tomatoes and shelled peas.\n9. Then, add another 80 g of water and sautee the spices till the water dries off.\n10. Add a slit green chilli and cook with the lid on for another minute.\n\n**PART IV—STEAMING THE CABBAGE**\n11. Add the shredded cabbage to the pan, along with the salt.\n12. Fold in the spices and cook on low heat with the lid on. The salt will start dehydrating the cabbage and drawing out its moisture.\n13. Steam the cabbage on low heat, with the lid on, for 12 minutes, stirring intermittently. Keep an eye on the pan to ensure that the cabbage doesn’t stick to the bottom.\n14. Add the sugar and cook for another 15 minutes, stirring intermittently. The sugar will soon start to caramelise. Be sure to scrape down and integrate the lightly browned bits of the _torkari_ that stick to the bottom of your pan (they are yummy!).\n15. This step is optional. You can coat a couple of cleaned prawns in a pinch of salt and turmeric powder, and fry in a separate pan for 30 seconds on each side. Chop the fried prawns in chunks of 1 cm, and add to the _ghonto_.\n16. Garnish with _ghee_, powdered _garam masala_, and a  slit green chilli.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | roti\n","slug":"badhakopir-ghonto","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-30T02:30:24.573Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjqrmmt3f000dyovhhkr1mhzx","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A dry curry of cabbage</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">This is a beautifully spiced cabbage-and-peas preparation that is a little hot, a little sweet, and with hints of ginger, <em>ghee</em>, and <em>garam masala</em>.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">B</span><em>adhakopi’r ghonto</em> is essentially prepared by steaming fine shreds of cabbage (about 2 mm wide) in their own moisture, which is drawn out with the help of salt.

Suffice it to say that it is probably unlike anything you’ve ever tasted, especially if seasoned with the right amount of salt and sugar. And we won’t even go into how drop-dead gorgeous the finished product is. The recipe is ridiculously simple. You smear thickly sliced brinjals in turmeric and seasoning, and fry them on medium heat in a skillet. The sugar in the marinade allows the brinjals to develop a wonderfully amber-coloured crust, and deepens the flavour of the dish. If you have 20 minutes to spare, give this recipe a try. Eat it along with steaming rice and dal, and you will not regret it.\n\nThis recipe uses one large brinjal. When shopping for the vegetable, be sure to select a specimen of the male variety as it is likely to contain far fewer seeds than its female counterpart. You can identify the type of the brinjal by looking at the indentation on its bottom. If the indentation is elongated and deep, it’s a female brinjal. And if it is round and shallow, that’s the seedless, male brinjal.</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 20 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 6 slices of _begun bhaja_\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient               |\n|----------|--------------------------|\n|  1 piece | Large brinjal            |\n|    ¼ tsp | Turmeric powder          |\n|  a pinch | Red chilli powder        |\n|    ¾ tsp | Salt                     |\n|   1½ tsp | Sugar                    |\n|    ¾ tsp | Flour (atta)             |\n|    ~80 g | Mustard oil (for frying) |\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Frying pan | skillet\n- Long spatula | _khunti_ | fork\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1.

Come Christmas, shops spring up all over the city selling Christmas cakes, or ‘Borodin’er cake’. The tradition of baking, gifting, and eating plum cakes around Christmas is an old one. Families celebrating Christmas in Kolkata soak their dried fruits weeks in advance and book their slots with their local bakers for community baking of their cakes. Making a Christmas fruitcake at home is easy, to say nothing of rewarding.  Such fruitcakes contain their characteristic booze-soaked fruits and nuts, which can be customised in dozens of ways. In this recipe, we show you how to bake an indulgent Christmas fruitcake at home.\n</p>\n\n## About the tin\nWe like our Christmas cake as a good-sized loaf. A 9 × 4 inch (25 × 11 cm) rectangular loaf tin perfectly holds our batter for a 4-pound cake. This is a deep tin, which produces a hefty fruitcake that can be portioned into slices. However, since such a tin is so deep and narrow, we’ve taken some special precautions to ensure that the cake (a) rises evenly, (b) doesn’t crack or dome on the top, (c) cooks to a rich brown colour right up to the centre, without (d) the sides drying out during its long stint in the oven.\n\n### Preparing the tin\n* Butter the inside of the tin, making sure to get into all the corners. \n* Line the tin with two sheets of baking paper [as shown in the video](https://youtu.be/Cd0x661PujE?t=2m43s), leaving about 5 cm excess overhanging paper on both sides for easier cae removal later on.\n* Optionally, **wrap a cake strip** to the outside of the tin for added protection. You can easily make a cake strip at home as follows:\n* Measure the circumference and height of your tin. \n* Cut a sheet of newspaper about 4–5 times as wide as the height of your tin and long enough to wrap around it.\n* Keep folding the newspaper into a strip as wide as the height of the tin.\n* Wet this strip with water, squeezing out any excess.\n* Cover the whole strip in aluminium foil.\n* Wrap it around the tin and secure it with a piece of wet cotton twine.\n\n## The oven\nThis cake bakes at a low temperature of 150°C. In a deep and narrow loaf tin like the one we’re using here, it takes around 3.5 hours. If you try to bake this cake faster by raising the temperature, the outside will brown while the inside remains pale and undercooked. Having said that, keep in mind that every oven is different. Be sure to check on your cake after the first 2 hours in the oven. \n\n\n***\n**COOKING TIME** 4 hours (including 3 hours of oven time)\n**YIELDS** 4-pound cake (serves 20–25 people)\n**CALORIES** 316 kcal per serving\n\n***\n\n## Ingredients\n|               Quantity | Ingredient                                   |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **SOAKING THE FRUITS** |                                              |\n|                  100 g | Raisins                                      |\n|                  150 g | Pitted dates                                 |\n|                  100 g | Dried apricots                               |\n|                  100 g | Tutti frutti                                 |\n|                  100 g | Crystallised ginger                          |\n|                  125 g | Orange/mixed peels                           |\n|                 180 ml | Dark rum/whiskey/brandy                      |\n|    **BAKING THE CAKE** |                                              |\n|                  275 g | Flour                                        |\n|                  275 g | Salted butter (softened; extra for greasing) |\n|                  275 g | Brown sugar                                  |\n|                      5 | Eggs                                         |\n|                   75 g | Almonds                                      |\n|                   40 g | Cashewnuts                                   |\n|                   40 g | Pistachio                                    |\n|        From one orange | Orange zest                                  |\n|                  8 pcs | Cloves                                       |\n|             4-cm stick | Cinnamon                                     |\n|                  ¼ tsp | Nutmeg                                       |\n|                 15 pcs | Allspice berries (optional)                  |\n\n\n<amp-img alt=\"Equipments used in baking the cake\" \n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/q_auto:good/v1511470622/tools_v2_mmmg7w.png\"\n  width=\"1920\"\n  height=\"1111\"\n  layout=\"responsive\">\n</amp-img>\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Balloon whisk\n- Spatula\n- 9 × 4 inch rectangular loaf tin\n- Greaseproof baking paper\n- Aluminium foil (optional)\n- Weighing scale\n- Knife\n- Sieve\n- Grater\n\n## Appliances\n- OTG or convection oven (you can't bake this in microwave mode)\n- Grinder | spice grinder | mortar and pestle\n\n\n## Method\n### Soaking the fruits:\n<amp-youtube\n    data-videoid=\"Wgrv5ithNrg\"\n    layout=\"responsive\"\n    width=\"480\" height=\"270\">\n</amp-youtube>\n\n1. Chop dates, apricots, ginger, and orange peels into 1 cm chunks.\n2. Put the chopped dates, apricots, ginger, and orange peels along with the raisins, and the tutti frutti into an airtight glass jar.\n3. Pour 180 ml of dark rum (we are using Old Monk), or brandy, or whiskey or a mixture into the jar over the fruits.\n4. Shut the jar and leave it in a cool, dark place for 20 days. Give the jar a mild shake every couple of days.\n\n### Baking the cake:\n1. Grind the cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice to a fine powder. Also grind up the almonds separately. Set these aside.\n2.  Zest an entire orange, making sure not to grate any of the white pith as it is bitter. Chop up the cashew and pistachio into 5 mm pieces.\n3. Prepare the tin as explained above and set your oven to preheat at 150°C.\n4. In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter until it is airy and pale. Add in the brown sugar and cream again.\n5. Now whisk in the eggs, one at a time. Follow this with the ground almond, spice mix, and orange zest. Incorporate everything thoroughly. Get rid of your whisk; you won’t need it after this point. \n6. Sift in the flour and fold it in using a rubber spatula. Make sure to not overmix the batter after you add the flour as the cake may turn chewy.\n7. Add the chopped cashew and pistachio. Also add your rum-soaked dried fruits. The fruits should have absorbed all the alcohol, but if they contain excess liquid, strain and add just the fruits.\n8. Mix everything until well combined, but don’t overwork the batter.\n9. Spoon the batter into your prepared cake tin, pushing it into all the corners and leveling the top. Tap out any trapped air bubbles.\n10. Place it in the preheated oven and bake for 3.5 hours, checking on it regularly after the first 2 hours. Your cake is done when a thermometer inserted in the centre registers a temperature of 95°C, or when a skewer comes out clean. Your cake should develop a rich brown colour.   \n11. Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool completely in the tin. This should take about 5 hours or so.\n12. **Feed the cake:** This step is optional. Poke holes in the cake with a skewer. ‘Feed’ a spoon of rum, brandy, or whisky through the holes. You can do this once a week for as long as you want, until you are ready to cut the cake. Store it at room temperature wrapped in baking paper and aluminium foil. \n\n\n## Served with\n- A cup of Darjeeling or coffee\n- Mulled wine","source":"_posts/calcutta-christmas-fruitcake.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Calcutta Christmas Fruitcake\ntags:\n  - Christmas\n  - cake\n  - Calcutta-style food\n  - sweet\ndescription: >-\n  The classic Calcutta fruitcake—a fixture in many homes around\n  Christmas-time—is a rum-soaked, fruit-and-nut encrusted indulgence.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1513283979/fruitcake-website-thumbnail-_ptemcp.png\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: Cd0x661PujE\ndate: 2017-12-15 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Calcutta Christmas Fruitcake\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1511482556/cake_optimized_bftkad.jpg\",\"description\":\"The classic Calcutta fruitcake—a fixture in many homes around Christmas-time—is a rum-soaked, fruit-and-nut encrusted indulgence.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT2H\",\"totalTime\":\"PT4H\",\"recipeYield\":\"20\",\"nutrition\":{\"@type\":\"NutritionInformation\",\"servingSize\":\"20 servings\",\"calories\":\"316 calories\"}, \"recipeIngredient\":[\"100 g Raisins\",\"150 g Pitted dates\",\"100 g Dried apricots\",\"100 g Tutti frutti\",\"100 g Crystallised ginger\",\"125 g Orange/mixed peels\",\"180 ml Dark rum/whiskey/brandy\",\"275 g Flour\",\"275 g Butter (softened; extra for greasing)\",\"275 g Brown sugar\",\"5 Eggs\",\"75 g Almonds\",\"40 g Cashewnuts\",\"40 g Pistachios\",\"From one orange Orange zest\",\"8 pcs Cloves\",\"4-cm stick Cinnamon\",\"¼ tsp Nutmeg\",\"15 pcs Allspice berries (optional)\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

Come Christmas, shops spring up all over the city selling Christmas cakes, or ‘Borodin’er cake’. The tradition of baking, gifting, and eating plum cakes around Christmas is an old one. Families celebrating Christmas in Kolkata soak their dried fruits weeks in advance and book their slots with their local bakers for community baking of their cakes. Making a Christmas fruitcake at home is easy, to say nothing of rewarding.  Such fruitcakes contain their characteristic booze-soaked fruits and nuts, which can be customised in dozens of ways. In this recipe, we show you how to bake an indulgent Christmas fruitcake at home.\n</p>\n\n## About the tin\nWe like our Christmas cake as a good-sized loaf. A 9 × 4 inch (25 × 11 cm) rectangular loaf tin perfectly holds our batter for a 4-pound cake. This is a deep tin, which produces a hefty fruitcake that can be portioned into slices. However, since such a tin is so deep and narrow, we’ve taken some special precautions to ensure that the cake (a) rises evenly, (b) doesn’t crack or dome on the top, (c) cooks to a rich brown colour right up to the centre, without (d) the sides drying out during its long stint in the oven.\n\n### Preparing the tin\n* Butter the inside of the tin, making sure to get into all the corners. \n* Line the tin with two sheets of baking paper [as shown in the video](https://youtu.be/Cd0x661PujE?t=2m43s), leaving about 5 cm excess overhanging paper on both sides for easier cae removal later on.\n* Optionally, **wrap a cake strip** to the outside of the tin for added protection. You can easily make a cake strip at home as follows:\n* Measure the circumference and height of your tin. \n* Cut a sheet of newspaper about 4–5 times as wide as the height of your tin and long enough to wrap around it.\n* Keep folding the newspaper into a strip as wide as the height of the tin.\n* Wet this strip with water, squeezing out any excess.\n* Cover the whole strip in aluminium foil.\n* Wrap it around the tin and secure it with a piece of wet cotton twine.\n\n## The oven\nThis cake bakes at a low temperature of 150°C. In a deep and narrow loaf tin like the one we’re using here, it takes around 3.5 hours. If you try to bake this cake faster by raising the temperature, the outside will brown while the inside remains pale and undercooked. Having said that, keep in mind that every oven is different. Be sure to check on your cake after the first 2 hours in the oven. \n\n\n***\n**COOKING TIME** 4 hours (including 3 hours of oven time)\n**YIELDS** 4-pound cake (serves 20–25 people)\n**CALORIES** 316 kcal per serving\n\n***\n\n## Ingredients\n|               Quantity | Ingredient                                   |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **SOAKING THE FRUITS** |                                              |\n|                  100 g | Raisins                                      |\n|                  150 g | Pitted dates                                 |\n|                  100 g | Dried apricots                               |\n|                  100 g | Tutti frutti                                 |\n|                  100 g | Crystallised ginger                          |\n|                  125 g | Orange/mixed peels                           |\n|                 180 ml | Dark rum/whiskey/brandy                      |\n|    **BAKING THE CAKE** |                                              |\n|                  275 g | Flour                                        |\n|                  275 g | Salted butter (softened; extra for greasing) |\n|                  275 g | Brown sugar                                  |\n|                      5 | Eggs                                         |\n|                   75 g | Almonds                                      |\n|                   40 g | Cashewnuts                                   |\n|                   40 g | Pistachio                                    |\n|        From one orange | Orange zest                                  |\n|                  8 pcs | Cloves                                       |\n|             4-cm stick | Cinnamon                                     |\n|                  ¼ tsp | Nutmeg                                       |\n|                 15 pcs | Allspice berries (optional)                  |\n\n\n<amp-img alt=\"Equipments used in baking the cake\" \n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/q_auto:good/v1511470622/tools_v2_mmmg7w.png\"\n  width=\"1920\"\n  height=\"1111\"\n  layout=\"responsive\">\n</amp-img>\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Balloon whisk\n- Spatula\n- 9 × 4 inch rectangular loaf tin\n- Greaseproof baking paper\n- Aluminium foil (optional)\n- Weighing scale\n- Knife\n- Sieve\n- Grater\n\n## Appliances\n- OTG or convection oven (you can't bake this in microwave mode)\n- Grinder | spice grinder | mortar and pestle\n\n\n## Method\n### Soaking the fruits:\n<amp-youtube\n    data-videoid=\"Wgrv5ithNrg\"\n    layout=\"responsive\"\n    width=\"480\" height=\"270\">\n</amp-youtube>\n\n1. Chop dates, apricots, ginger, and orange peels into 1 cm chunks.\n2. Put the chopped dates, apricots, ginger, and orange peels along with the raisins, and the tutti frutti into an airtight glass jar.\n3. Pour 180 ml of dark rum (we are using Old Monk), or brandy, or whiskey or a mixture into the jar over the fruits.\n4. Shut the jar and leave it in a cool, dark place for 20 days. Give the jar a mild shake every couple of days.\n\n### Baking the cake:\n1. Grind the cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice to a fine powder. Also grind up the almonds separately. Set these aside.\n2.  Zest an entire orange, making sure not to grate any of the white pith as it is bitter. Chop up the cashew and pistachio into 5 mm pieces.\n3. Prepare the tin as explained above and set your oven to preheat at 150°C.\n4. In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter until it is airy and pale. Add in the brown sugar and cream again.\n5. Now whisk in the eggs, one at a time. Follow this with the ground almond, spice mix, and orange zest. Incorporate everything thoroughly. Get rid of your whisk; you won’t need it after this point. \n6. Sift in the flour and fold it in using a rubber spatula. Make sure to not overmix the batter after you add the flour as the cake may turn chewy.\n7. Add the chopped cashew and pistachio. Also add your rum-soaked dried fruits. The fruits should have absorbed all the alcohol, but if they contain excess liquid, strain and add just the fruits.\n8. Mix everything until well combined, but don’t overwork the batter.\n9. Spoon the batter into your prepared cake tin, pushing it into all the corners and leveling the top. Tap out any trapped air bubbles.\n10. Place it in the preheated oven and bake for 3.5 hours, checking on it regularly after the first 2 hours. Your cake is done when a thermometer inserted in the centre registers a temperature of 95°C, or when a skewer comes out clean. Your cake should develop a rich brown colour.   \n11. Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool completely in the tin. This should take about 5 hours or so.\n12. **Feed the cake:** This step is optional. Poke holes in the cake with a skewer. ‘Feed’ a spoon of rum, brandy, or whisky through the holes. You can do this once a week for as long as you want, until you are ready to cut the cake.

Also grind up the almonds separately. Set these aside.</li>\n<li>Zest an entire orange, making sure not to grate any of the white pith as it is bitter. Chop up the cashew and pistachio into 5 mm pieces.</li>\n<li>Prepare the tin as explained above and set your oven to preheat at 150°C.</li>\n<li>In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter until it is airy and pale. Add in the brown sugar and cream again.</li>\n<li>Now whisk in the eggs, one at a time. Follow this with the ground almond, spice mix, and orange zest. Incorporate everything thoroughly. Get rid of your whisk; you won’t need it after this point. </li>\n<li>Sift in the flour and fold it in using a rubber spatula. Make sure to not overmix the batter after you add the flour as the cake may turn chewy.</li>\n<li>Add the chopped cashew and pistachio. Also add your rum-soaked dried fruits. The fruits should have absorbed all the alcohol, but if they contain excess liquid, strain and add just the fruits.</li>\n<li>Mix everything until well combined, but don’t overwork the batter.</li>\n<li>Spoon the batter into your prepared cake tin, pushing it into all the corners and leveling the top. Tap out any trapped air bubbles.</li>\n<li>Place it in the preheated oven and bake for 3.5 hours, checking on it regularly after the first 2 hours. Your cake is done when a thermometer inserted in the centre registers a temperature of 95°C, or when a skewer comes out clean. Your cake should develop a rich brown colour.   </li>\n<li>Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool completely in the tin. This should take about 5 hours or so.</li>\n<li><strong>Feed the cake:</strong> This step is optional. Poke holes in the cake with a skewer. ‘Feed’ a spoon of rum, brandy, or whisky through the holes. You can do this once a week for as long as you want, until you are ready to cut the cake.

It is a blend of whole spices, whose proportions vary from cuisine to cuisine. The Bengali version comprises three simple spices—cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves.</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">W</span>hile the _garam masala_ used in most northern and western Indian cooking might contain everything from coriander and cumin seeds to mustard seeds, the Bengali version, in its most basic form, is made up of cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves. The preparation is simple. We dry-roast a blend of the whole spices to awaken their dormant flavours and powder them—either by hand on in an electric grinder. If stored in an airtight container, the _masala_ can keep for months.  \n\nIn Bengali cooking, _garam masala_ is used to flavour egg, chicken, mutton, lamb, or beef curries. Along with _ghee_, it is also used as garnish for several vegetarian preparations (most _ghontos_ and [_dalnas_](/tags/dalna/ \"Bengali dalna recipes\"), _khichuri_, and _panchmishali torkari_). This spice is particularly handy if you want to quickly refresh leftovers. Just add a pinch of it (along with a sliver of _ghee_) to your day-old _torkari_ while reheating, and no one need be any the wiser!\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 10 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 10 g of _garam masala_ powder\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient       |\n|----------|------------------|\n|      7 g | Cardamom (whole) |\n|      2 g | Cloves (whole)   |\n|      2 g | Cinnamon (whole) |\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | wok | frying pan\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n- Airtight container\n\n## Appliances\n- Grinder | mortar and pestle\n\n## Method\n1.

In a mixing bowl large enough to hold all the chicken, combine the components of the marinade: that is, sliced onions, chopped garlic, ginger paste, chopped green chillies, yoghurt, turmeric powder (10 g), red chilli powder, [_garam masala_](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/) powder, salt (10 g), lime juice, and raw mustard oil. Don’t throw the lime peel away.\n2. Give these a good mix and then add the chicken to the bowl.\n3. Coat the chicken pieces in the marinade, making sure to get into all the nooks and crannies of the chicken. If you are also cooking the chicken liver, don’t toss it in the marinade along with the other pieces of the chicken, as it might disintegrate. Instead, add the liver after all the chicken pieces are well coated, and smear the liver with the marinade then.\n4. Stick the used lime peel in between the chicken pieces.\n5. Cover the bowl and rest the marinated chicken in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. For best results, leave it to marinate overnight.\n\n**STEP II—PREPARING THE CURRY**\n1. Peel and divide the potatoes into 4-cm halves or quarters. Put these in a microwave-safe bowl, add 2 tablespoons of water, cover the bowl with a cling film, and microwave for about 3 to 4 minutes. Alternatively, you can also parboil the potatoes in water on the stove.\n2. Cut the onions in thin slices. Thinly sliced onions (as opposed to roughly chopped or diced onions) give the curry the perfect texture.\n3. Heat 30 g mustard oil in a _kadai_. Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, temper it with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns.\n4. Add in the onions, along with the sugar, and fry them for about 8 to 10 minutes, till the onions are brown in colour. (We add the sugar at this stage to help the onions caramelize quickly.)\n5. Once the onions have caramelized, add 8 g turmeric powder and 18 g salt, along with 75 g of water.\n6. Fry the spices on medium heat till the water dries up. This should take about 5 minutes.\n7. Tip the marinated chicken into the _kadai_ (don’t forget to remove the lime peel from the bowl!), and mix it with the onions in the pan. Cook the chicken on medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will ensure that the smell of raw spices from the marinade is gone.\n8. Add in the parboiled potatoes and slit green chillies, and stir them in.\n8. Add 400 g of hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n9. Cover the pan and let the curry bubble for about 15 to 20 minutes, or till the chicken and potatoes are tender.\n10. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves.  \n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- Roti | [Luchi](/recipe/luchi/)\n- [Fried rice](/recipe/bengali-vegetable-fried-rice/)\n","source":"_posts/chicken-curry.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Chicken Curry\ntags:\n  - chicken\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\ndescription: >-\n  A hot, spicy, and delicious Bengali chicken curry, packed full of the flavours\n  of ginger, garlic, and shahi garam masala.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1490315506/chicken-curry-website-thumbnail_xc4csh.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: u6vCNSosGrc\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Chicken Curry or Kosha\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1490315506/chicken-curry-website-thumbnail_xc4csh.jpg\",\"description\":\"  A hot, spicy, and delicious Bengali chicken curry, packed full of the flavours of ginger, garlic, and shahi garam masala.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT30M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT90M\",\"recipeYield\":\"6 servings\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"Onions (sliced) 25 g\",\"Garlic (finely chopped) 8 g\",\"Dried red chillies 2 pcs\",\"Green chillies (finely chopped) 2 pcs\",\"Ginger paste 25 g\",\"Yoghurt 60 g\",\"Turmeric powder 10 g\",\"Red chilli powder 2 g\",\"Garam masala powder 2 g\",\"Salt 10 g\",\"Lime juice 5 g\",\"Mustard oil 10 g\",\"FOR THE CURRY Chicken (cut and cleaned) 1 kg\",\"Potatoes (halved or quartered) 200 g\",\"Onions (thinly sliced) 300 g\",\"Mustard oil 30 g\",\"Dried red chillies 2 pcs\",\"Bay leaves 2 pcs\",\"Cardamom 3 pcs\",\"Cloves 3 pcs\",\"Cinnamon 1 pc\",\"Peppercorns 8 pcs\",\"Turmeric powder\",\"Salt 18 g\",\"Sugar 10 g\",\"Coriander leaves (optional; finely chopped) 10 g\",\"Green chillies (slit) 2 pcs\",\"Hot water 400 g\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

In a mixing bowl large enough to hold all the chicken, combine the components of the marinade: that is, sliced onions, chopped garlic, ginger paste, chopped green chillies, yoghurt, turmeric powder (10 g), red chilli powder, [_garam masala_](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/) powder, salt (10 g), lime juice, and raw mustard oil. Don’t throw the lime peel away.\n2. Give these a good mix and then add the chicken to the bowl.\n3. Coat the chicken pieces in the marinade, making sure to get into all the nooks and crannies of the chicken. If you are also cooking the chicken liver, don’t toss it in the marinade along with the other pieces of the chicken, as it might disintegrate. Instead, add the liver after all the chicken pieces are well coated, and smear the liver with the marinade then.\n4. Stick the used lime peel in between the chicken pieces.\n5. Cover the bowl and rest the marinated chicken in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. For best results, leave it to marinate overnight.\n\n**STEP II—PREPARING THE CURRY**\n1. Peel and divide the potatoes into 4-cm halves or quarters. Put these in a microwave-safe bowl, add 2 tablespoons of water, cover the bowl with a cling film, and microwave for about 3 to 4 minutes. Alternatively, you can also parboil the potatoes in water on the stove.\n2. Cut the onions in thin slices. Thinly sliced onions (as opposed to roughly chopped or diced onions) give the curry the perfect texture.\n3. Heat 30 g mustard oil in a _kadai_. Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, temper it with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns.\n4. Add in the onions, along with the sugar, and fry them for about 8 to 10 minutes, till the onions are brown in colour. (We add the sugar at this stage to help the onions caramelize quickly.)\n5. Once the onions have caramelized, add 8 g turmeric powder and 18 g salt, along with 75 g of water.\n6. Fry the spices on medium heat till the water dries up. This should take about 5 minutes.\n7. Tip the marinated chicken into the _kadai_ (don’t forget to remove the lime peel from the bowl!), and mix it with the onions in the pan. Cook the chicken on medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will ensure that the smell of raw spices from the marinade is gone.\n8. Add in the parboiled potatoes and slit green chillies, and stir them in.\n8. Add 400 g of hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n9. Cover the pan and let the curry bubble for about 15 to 20 minutes, or till the chicken and potatoes are tender.\n10. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves.  \n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- Roti | [Luchi](/recipe/luchi/)\n- [Fried rice](/recipe/bengali-vegetable-fried-rice/)\n","slug":"chicken-curry","published":1,"updated":"2017-12-29T06:16:23.273Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjqrmmt4c000vyovhm88bn7mm","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">Hot and spicy, decadent and comforting</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">This versatile chicken curry can be eaten with rice for a hearty weeknight dinner, or as part of an elaborate Sunday lunch.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">T</span>his chicken curry recipe yields tender chicken pieces in a hot, flavourful, stew-like <em>jhol</em> (curry).

The curry also contains pumpkin (_kumro_) and potatoes in chunky cubes, which get juicy with the flavourful _jhol_. This is a Bengali-style _dalna_ (curry), so it contains the usual suspects—whole garam masala, ginger, cumin, red chilli, and turmeric. However, the proportions of the spices here is dialled down to a great extent so as not to overpower the flavour of the prawns. \n\nThis kumro-chingri recipe is so quick to put together that it can be prepared on busy weekdays to go with some steaming, hot rice. If you like the idea of a hearty Bengali-style prawn curry, with some nutritious pumpkin thrown in for good measure, you must give this recipe a try. \n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 30 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n**CALORIES** 155 kcal per serving\n***\n\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient               | \n|----------|--------------------------|\n|    250 g | Prawns                   |\n|    300 g | Pumpkin (5-cm cubes)     |\n|    150 g | Potatoes (4-cm cubes)    |\n|     20 g | Tomato (roughly chopped) |\n|     35 g | Mustard oil              |\n|     1 pc | Cardamom                 |\n|     1 pc | Cinnamon                 |\n|     1 pc | Clove                    |\n|    2 pcs | Dried red chillies       |\n|     1 pc | Bay leaf                 |\n|    ¼ tsp | Cumin seeds              |\n|    ½ tsp | Turmeric powder          |\n|    ½ tsp | Cumin powder             |\n|    ¼ tsp | Red chilli powder        |\n|     15 g | Ginger paste             |\n|     10 g | Salt                     |\n|     15 g | Sugar                    |\n|     1 pc | Green chilli (slit)      |\n|    225 g | Water                    |\n\n\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan (with lid)\n-  _Khunti_ | long spatula\n- A pair of scissors (for cleaning prawns)\n\n\n## Method\n\n1.

It can be cooked in several different ways. In fact, nearly all East and Southeast Asian cultures have variations of this popular dish. In India, besides the Tibetan and Nepali versions, the Goan, Mangalorean and Kerala-style chilli pork are well known (and who among us doesn’t enjoy the dry, dark Coorgi chilli pork?) .\n  \nWe like our chilli pork juicy, where stir-fried pork slices are accompanied with hot green chillies in every bite. We’re using the pork belly as it is fatty, but you could also use the leaner shoulder. This simple recipe leads to twice-cooked chilli pork. The meat is first boiled until tender and then stir-fried. This recipe is also reminiscent of the chilli pork on the menus of several Chinese restaurants in Calcutta. \n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 60 minutes\n**YIELDS** 6 servings\n***\n\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                         |\n|----------|------------------------------------|\n|     1 kg | Pork belly or shoulder (5-cm logs) |\n|     20 g | Ginger (roughly chopped)           |\n|     10 g | Garlic (sliced)                    |\n|    300 g | Onions (3-cm squares)              |\n|     25 g | Green chillies (slit)              |\n|     60 g | Tomatoes (diced)                   |\n|     20 g | Vegetable oil                      |\n|  2–3 pcs | Star anise                         |\n|     25 g | Soy sauce (½ light, ½ dark)        |\n|     23 g | Salt                               |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Wok | _kadai_\n- Pressure cooker\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1.

Boil the pork in the pressure cooker on medium heat for 45 minutes. Transfer the pork to a plate and chill it in the fridge for about 30 minutes, to enable clean slicing later on. Once chilled, slice the pork about 5 mm wide. \n3. Heat vegetable oil in a wok on high heat. Add the star anise, sliced pork, and half the green chillies. Toss or stir until fat renders from the pork. This should take about 4 to 5 minutes. \n4. Then add the onion squares and fry for about 6 minutes until they are softened. Add the tomatoes and green chillies and fry for another 2 minutes.\n5. Finally, add the soy sauce and salt. Toss to combine.

Shell and devein the prawns, leaving the flavourful head intact. You may remove the stomach of the prawn, located near its head. We are leaving the shells on, but you may peel them off if you like.\n2. Coat prawns with 1 tsp salt and ½ tsp turmeric powder, and set aside.\n3. In a grinder jar, add onions and blitz them to a fine paste. Also extract coconut milk, reserving the first-press (thick) and second-press (thinner) milk in separate jars, and keep it ready.\n4. Heat vegetable oil in a pan. Once hot, lower the prawns one by one, and fry them in batches for about 45 seconds on each side. The longer you cook prawns the tougher they’ll become, so remove them from the heat immediately and set aside.\n5. Now add ghee to the residual oil. Temper with dried red chillies, bay leaf, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon.\n6. Add onion paste along with sugar, and fry for about 8 minutes until the onions are brown. \n7. Add ginger paste and fry for another 3–4 minutes, after which add turmeric and kashmiri red chilli powder. Stir intermittently so that the spices don’t stick to the bottom of the pan. When they do, add a splash of the thin, second-press coconut milk to loosen the mixture up and help fry it. Also add three slit green chillies and salt now.\n8. Once oil starts separating from the spices, beat the yoghurt until it is lump free and add it to the pan. Drop the heat and stir vigorously to prevent the yoghurt from splitting. Cook it for 3–4 minutes.\n9. Add the second-press (thin) coconut milk and simmer for about 2 minutes before adding the first-press (thick) coconut milk. Once it comes to a boil, add the fried prawns.\n10. Allow the prawns to bubble in the curry, covered, for no more than 5 minutes. \n11. Finish off with [garam masala](/recipe/bengali-garam-masala/) before serving.\n\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- [Polao](/recipe/mishti-polao/)\n- [Bengali fried rice](/recipe/bengali-vegetable-fried-rice/)","slug":"chingri-malaikari","published":1,"updated":"2018-07-09T03:58:59.975Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjqrmmt4p0018yovhyxfnef3a","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">Creamy Bengali prawn curry with coconut milk</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Inspired by Malay flavours, ‘malai’-kari is an iconic Bengali prawn recipe made using giant tiger or freshwater prawns and fresh, creamy coconut milk.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">C</span>hingri malaikari is an iconic Bengali prawn curry made by cooking large tiger prawns (bagda chingri) or giant freshwater prawns (golda chingri) in a super-subtle, super-creamy coconut-milk sauce.

Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city. Make these at home, or hunt them down from the source—irrespective of how you get your hands on these items, we hope you enjoy them._]\n\n<span class=\"dropcap\">C</span>hilli chicken is perhaps the most popular Indo-Chinese dish found both in restaurants and street side stalls. No visit to Calcutta's Chinatowns (especially Tangra) is complete without an order of chilli chicken. The dry chilli chicken works as a snack, appetiser as well as a side. The gravy chilli chicken is more popular as a side to either chowmein or with fried rice. There are various versions of the chilli chicken recipes. While you can play around with the sauces you like in your chilli chicken, most folks will agree that the best chilli chicken has the chicken still crispy when served.

What yielded the crunchiest chicken was Kenji Lopez-Alt’s method which he had used in his <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/04/the-food-lab-bringing-home-general-tsos-chick.html\">General Tso’s Chicken recipe in Serious Eats Food Lab</a>.

Soak poppy seeds, cashew nuts and charmagaz in water for at least 2 hours. Then, drain the water and make a paste, first of the poppy seeds, and then of cashew and charmagaz together. \n2. Roughly chop onions, ginger, garlic, and green chillies, and make a paste of these too.\n3. Transfer all the pasted ingredients to a large mixing bowl.\n4. Mix in yoghurt, chhatu, shahi garam masala, kashmiri red chilli powder, turmeric, salt, kewra water, rose water, meetha attar, and saffron (mixed in 1 tbsp warm milk).\n5. Grate khoya kheer and add it to the bowl too.\n6. If your meat is particularly tough, you can add grated papaya to the mix. Papaya skin contains an enzyme called papain, which breaks down meat proteins and helps tenderise it.\n7. Lay a beef slice between two sheets of plastic and use a mallet or pestle to gently flatten it. This will lead to tender chaap. However, be careful not to hammer too forcefully or the meat may fall apart. \n8. Add the slices to the prepared mixture, making sure to coat each slice well on both sides. Leave them to marinate for 2 hours.\n9. Heat a dalda, ghee, and vegetable oil in a large, flat, heavy-bottomed pan on low heat. We used these in the ratio 2:1:4. The fat should be 2cm deep. Don’t heat the oil up too much; chaap needs to be fried in oil at a very low temperature (150°C) for a long time.\n10. Lower the marinated beef into the oil. Try and keep the meat as far away from the direct flame as possible. The best practice is to line the edge of the pan with the meat. \n11. Fry for about an hour or until the meat is tender, turning over once in a while to cook it evenly from both sides.\n12. Once the meat is soft enough that it breaks apart using just two fingers and the gravy has acquired a nutty brown colour, remove from the oil and serve.\n\n\n\n## Served with\n- Naan\n- Tandoori rooti\n- Roomali rooti\n- Porota\n- Biryani\n","source":"_posts/beef-chaap.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Calcutta-style Beef Chaap\ntags:\n  - beef\n  - mughlai\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\ndescription: >-\n  Ultimate Mughlai delicacy of thin slices of lean beef marinated in a nutty\n  rich marinade and slow cooked in fat\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1519959818/peyaj-diye-mosur-dal-website-thumbnail-_cdbjdc.png\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: DfXOiwwl5F8\ndate: 2018-05-24 09:00:00\njsonLd:\n---\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"post-byline\">Thin slices of meat marinated and cooked slowly in fat</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Ultimate Mughlai delicacy of thin slices of lean beef marinated in a nutty rich marinade and slow cooked in fat</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n[_In this series, we tip our hats to some of our favourite dishes available in the restaurants, cafés, and cabins of Calcutta.

Chaap is as ubiquitous in Kolkata’s Mughlai eateries, big and small, as biryani. Beef chaap is specially popular among aficionados. In this video, we show you how to recreate restaurant-style, tender, melt-in-your-mouth beef chaap, championed by joints such as Asma, Nafeel, Zam Zam, Afreen, Arafat, and their ilk, at home.</p>\n<p>Chaap is basically a preparation where thin slices of meat are marinated, usually tenderised, and fried in oil at very low temperature over a long period of time. Bengali cuisines both sides of the border make varying kinds of dry and gravy-laden chaap preparations. The Kolkata chaap in particular has generous amounts of spicy gravy and is served with a drizzling of the oil it is cooked it. Enjoy it with naan, tandoori rooti, roomali rooti, porota, or a plate of warm aromatic biryani.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 2 hours 30 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 6 servings<br><strong>CALORIES</strong> Really?</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>500 g</td>\n<td>Beef (1cm thick slices)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50 g</td>\n<td>Onion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Ginger</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Garlic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 pcs</td>\n<td>Green chillies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>40 g</td>\n<td>Cashew nuts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50 g</td>\n<td>Charmagaz (mixed melon seeds)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 g</td>\n<td>Posto (poppy seeds)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Chhatu (roasted-gram flour)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>120 g</td>\n<td>Yoghurt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 g</td>\n<td>Khoya kheer or mawa (reduced, solidified milk)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 g</td>\n<td>Shahi garam masala</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Kashmiri red chilli powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 g</td>\n<td>Turmeric</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8 g</td>\n<td>Kewra water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Rose water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 drops</td>\n<td>Meetha attar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pinch</td>\n<td>Saffron (in 1 tbsp milk)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pinch</td>\n<td>Yellow food colour (optional)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Kacha pepe (unripe, green papaya; optional)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Dalda (vegetable shortening)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Ghee</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Vegetable oil</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Mixing bowl</li>\n<li>Mallet or pestle</li>\n<li>Grater</li>\n<li>Large, flat, heavy-bottomed pan</li>\n<li><em>Jhhajhhri</em> | perforated frying spoon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n<li>Grinder</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Soak poppy seeds, cashew nuts and charmagaz in water for at least 2 hours.

Line two round cake tins with baking paper after greasing them well with cold butter.\n2. Dust the sides of the tins with cocoa. Pre-heat your oven to 150 degrees Celcius.\n3. Sift together all the dry ingredients—flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, instant coffee powder, salt and powdered sugar.\n4. Whisk 3 eggs in a separate bowl.\n5. Whisk as you pour the melted butter into the egg.\n6. Add the yoghurt and whisk until smooth.\n7. Add the milk and mix.\n8. Add the wet mixture into the dry mixture and roughly mix. Don't try to smoothen this now.\n9. Add the boiling water and quickly whisk into a smooth velvety batter.\n10. Divide the batter into the cake tins—roughly 650g of batter in each.\n11. Bake for 40 minutes until a probe inserted into the center comes clean or an instant read thermometer registers 95 degree Celcius.\n12. Cool the cakes completely in the tin.\n\n### Making the ganache\n1. Heat the heavy cream in a saucepan until hot. It should not simmer or boil.\n2. Chop good quality eating chocolate into fine and even pieces and place in a bowl.\n3. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate shards. Allow this to sit for five minutes.\n4. Use a spatula to stir this into a silky ganache.\n\n### Decorating the chocolate cake\n1. On a rotating cake stand overturn one of the cakes. The flat bottom of the cake should be facing upwards.\n2. Pour some ganache and form a thin layer. Place the second cake, upside down on the top of the first cake.\n3. Pour the rest of the ganache on top and coat all over.\n\n## Related recipes\n- [Christmas cake](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- [Old fashioned steamed pudding with tea-infused custard](/recipe/mishti-polao/)\n","source":"_posts/chocolate-cake.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Chocolate Cake\ntags:\n  - dessert\n  - pudding\n  - christmas\n  - bake\ndescription: >-\n  Rich, moist, tender chocolate cake with a silky dark chocolate\n  ganache—classic!\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1545369919/chocolate-cake-optimized_w7nyqq.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: dtyekBblwkA\ndate: 2018-12-20 09:00:00\njsonLd:\n---\n\n\n<p class=\"post-byline\">A chocolate cake for the ages</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Rich, moist, tender chocolate cake with a silky dark chocolate ganache—classic!</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<span class=\"dropcap\">A</span>s we bring the 2018 Christmas celebrations on this channel to a close, we leave you with a perfect dessert to ring in the new year.

Our rich chocolate cake is constructed in two tiers. The sponge is moist and delicate, and melts in your mouth. Sandwiched between the sponges and smothered around them is a silky, decadent dark-chocolate ganache. This is a cake for birthdays and special occasions. But let’s be real, you (and we) would eat this any day of the week.</p>\n<p>The tender crumb structure of the sponges comes largely from emulsifying the fat in the other liquids. Also unusual is this recipe’s use of boiling hot water, which apart from reducing gluten (which tends to make cakes chewy) also helps with the emulsion. Here, we’d be remiss if we didn’t credit <a href=\"https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/ultimate-chocolate-cake\">ChefSteps’ chocolate cake recipe</a>.

While the potatoes are boiling, add 75 g hot water to the tamarind and allow it to soak for 15 minutes. This will soften the tamarind and ensure easy extraction of the pulp. Work the tamarind between your fingers to separate the skin and seeds. Press to squeeze out all the juice and discard the seeds. You should be left with some smooth tamarind pulp.","4.

Rinse the chhola’r dal well and soak it in water for at least 2 hours. After this time, strain the dal and transfer it to a boiling pot or pressure cooker. Add 700 g water, 6 g salt, and the bay leaves. Boil the dal until it is tender, but the grains are still whole. The texture of this dish will depend a whole lot on how well the dal is boiled. We want each grain of lentil to be perfectly cooked, but not turned to mush. On medium heat, our chhola’r dal cooks to the desired doneness in 2 whistles. The time may vary for you.","2. Before you begin cooking, make a spice slurry by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder and 50 g water. Also, slice the coconut and slit the green chillies.","3. Heat mustard oil in a pan (on medium heat) and once it starts to smoke lightly and changes colour to a pale yellow, add the thinly sliced coconut. Fry until the coconut turns golden brown. This should take about a minute. Remove from the oil and set aside.","4. Temper the same oil with the dried red chillies, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. Stir in the hing, allowing it to fry for about 10 seconds.","5. Add the spice slurry we made earlier to the pan. Fry on medium heat until the raw smell of the spices is gone. This should take about 6 minutes. Add the slit green chillies and raisins, and continue frying until you see oil leaving the sides of the spice mixture.","6. Now add the boiled dal along with the water to the pan. (If you feel there’s a lot of excess water with the dal, reserve some in a bowl.)","7. Add the remaining salt (12 g) and allow the dal to bubble until it thickens (about 6 to 8 minutes). Depending on how soft or hard your dal is, you may have to adjust the flame and water accordingly. For example, if your dal is still slightly hard, boil on low heat, adding water to maintain consistency, until it is cooked. If it is on the softer, mushier side (first of all, you need to make note of where you went wrong and try correcting the boiling time on your next attempt!), turn up the flame to thicken the dal quickly.","8. Pick out a softened green chilli from the dal, mash it with the back of a spoon and add it back to the dal. Add the sugar and bubble for about a minute before stirring in the ghee, Bengali garam masala, and fried coconut. Allow the dal to rest, covered, for 2 minutes before serving."]},"_content":"\n\n\n<p class=\"post-byline\">Savoury-sweet preparation of curried split Bengal gram</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Breakfast, lunch, dinner—this is a dal recipe for all occasions.</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<span class=\"dropcap\">E</span>very family has its own the classic Bengali _chholar dal_ recipe.

Rinse the _chhola’r dal_ well and soak it in water for at least 2 hours. After this time, strain the _dal_ and transfer it to a boiling pot or pressure cooker. Add 700 g water, 6 g salt, and the bay leaves. Boil the _dal_ until it is tender, but the grains are still whole. The texture of this dish will depend a whole lot on how well the _dal_ is boiled. We want each grain of lentil to be perfectly cooked, but not turned to mush. On medium heat, our _chhola’r dal_ cooks to the desired doneness in 2 whistles. The time may vary for you.\n2. Before you begin cooking, make a spice slurry by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder and 50 g water. Also, slice the coconut and slit the green chillies. \n3. Heat mustard oil in a pan (on medium heat) and once it starts to smoke lightly and changes colour to a pale yellow, add the thinly sliced coconut. Fry until the coconut turns golden brown. This should take about a minute. Remove from the oil and set aside. \n4. Temper the same oil with the dried red chillies, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. Stir in the _hing_, allowing it to fry for about 10 seconds. \n5. Add the spice slurry we made earlier to the pan. Fry on medium heat until the raw smell of the spices is gone. This should take about 6 minutes. Add the slit green chillies and raisins, and continue frying until you see oil leaving the sides of the spice mixture. \n6. Now add the boiled _dal_ along with the water to the pan. (If you feel there’s a lot of excess water with the _dal_, reserve some in a bowl.) \n7. Add the remaining salt (12 g) and allow the _dal_ to bubble until it thickens (about 6 to 8 minutes). Depending on how soft or hard your _dal_ is, you may have to adjust the flame and water accordingly. For example, if your _dal_ is still slightly hard, boil on low heat, adding water to maintain consistency, until it is cooked. If it is on the softer, mushier side (first of all, you need to make note of where you went wrong and try correcting the boiling time on your next attempt!), turn up the flame to thicken the dal quickly. \n8. Pick out a softened green chilli from the _dal_, mash it with the back of a spoon and add it back to the dal. Add the sugar and bubble for about a minute before stirring in the _ghee_, [_Bengali garam masala_](/recipe/bengali-garam-masala), and fried coconut. Allow the _dal_ to rest, covered, for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Luchi](/recipe/luchi/)\n- [Begun bhaja](/recipe/begun-bhaja)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- [Bengali fried rice](/recipe/bengali-vegetable-fried-rice/)","source":"_posts/cholar-dal.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Chhola’r Dal\ntags:\n  - vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\n  - dal\ndescription: >-\n  The savoury-sweet cholar dal is a Bengali classic.

After this time, strain the <em>dal</em> and transfer it to a boiling pot or pressure cooker. Add 700 g water, 6 g salt, and the bay leaves. Boil the <em>dal</em> until it is tender, but the grains are still whole. The texture of this dish will depend a whole lot on how well the <em>dal</em> is boiled. We want each grain of lentil to be perfectly cooked, but not turned to mush. On medium heat, our <em>chhola’r dal</em> cooks to the desired doneness in 2 whistles. The time may vary for you.</li>\n<li>Before you begin cooking, make a spice slurry by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder and 50 g water. Also, slice the coconut and slit the green chillies. </li>\n<li>Heat mustard oil in a pan (on medium heat) and once it starts to smoke lightly and changes colour to a pale yellow, add the thinly sliced coconut. Fry until the coconut turns golden brown. This should take about a minute. Remove from the oil and set aside. </li>\n<li>Temper the same oil with the dried red chillies, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. Stir in the <em>hing</em>, allowing it to fry for about 10 seconds. </li>\n<li>Add the spice slurry we made earlier to the pan. Fry on medium heat until the raw smell of the spices is gone. This should take about 6 minutes. Add the slit green chillies and raisins, and continue frying until you see oil leaving the sides of the spice mixture. </li>\n<li>Now add the boiled <em>dal</em> along with the water to the pan. (If you feel there’s a lot of excess water with the <em>dal</em>, reserve some in a bowl.) </li>\n<li>Add the remaining salt (12 g) and allow the <em>dal</em> to bubble until it thickens (about 6 to 8 minutes). Depending on how soft or hard your <em>dal</em> is, you may have to adjust the flame and water accordingly. For example, if your <em>dal</em> is still slightly hard, boil on low heat, adding water to maintain consistency, until it is cooked. If it is on the softer, mushier side (first of all, you need to make note of where you went wrong and try correcting the boiling time on your next attempt!), turn up the flame to thicken the dal quickly. </li>\n<li>Pick out a softened green chilli from the <em>dal</em>, mash it with the back of a spoon and add it back to the dal. Add the sugar and bubble for about a minute before stirring in the <em>ghee</em>, <a href=\"/recipe/bengali-garam-masala\"><em>Bengali garam masala</em></a>, and fried coconut. Allow the <em>dal</em> to rest, covered, for 2 minutes before serving.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Served-with\"><a href=\"#Served-with\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Served with\"></a>Served with</h2><ul>\n<li><a href=\"/recipe/luchi/\">Luchi</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/recipe/begun-bhaja\">Begun bhaja</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/\">Rice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/recipe/bengali-vegetable-fried-rice/\">Bengali fried rice</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"title":"Ilish Bhaja","description":"Bengali's favourite hilsa deep-fried in mustard oil until crunchy and sizzling.

Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city. Make these at home, or hunt them down from the source—irrespective of how you get your hands on these items, we hope you enjoy them._]\n\n<span class=\"dropcap\">E</span>ma datshi is the national dish of Bhutan, and rightly so. All across the country, residents and travellers alike can be seen eating this hearty concoction of cheese and chillies. Apart from Bhutan, this preparation is also consumed in several parts of Northeast India and Nepal. ‘Ema’ and ‘datshi’ literally stand for ‘chillies’ and ‘cheese’, and as such can be made using one or more varieties of either ingredient. ‘Datshi’ is also used to refer to any cheese-based soup (the version with potatoes, for example, is called ‘kewa datshi’ where ‘kewa’ means potatoes). \n\nThis dish can be prepared using an assortment of chilli peppers for flavour. We’ve used jalapeños, but look for slightly large chillies such as those commonly used for _achar_ or pickles. We’ve combined them with green chillies, which provide the heat. As for cheese, any good, locally available melting cheese (such as that commonly found in New Market in Calcutta) will do. In a pinch, you can also use processed cheese. Avoid using a stringy cheese like mozzarella for this soup. \n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 25 minutes\n**YIELDS** 2 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient               |\n|----------|--------------------------|\n|    220 g | Jalapeños (quartered)    |\n|      6 g | Green chillies (slit)    |\n|     70 g | Onions (sliced)          |\n|     15 g | Garlic (roughly chopped) |\n|     50 g | Tomatoes (diced)         |\n|     75 g | Cheese (grated)          |\n|     15 g | Butter                   |\n|      7 g | Vegetable oil            |\n|      5 g | Salt                     |\n|    250 g | Water                    |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Saucepan | _kadai_ with lid\n- Cheese grater\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1.

While there are innumerable ways of boiling rice and there appears to be no set formula, keeping a few things in mind is useful. (1) Washing the rice thoroughly and repeatedly helps get rid of the starch that usually contributes to its stickiness. (2) Rice, like pasta, must be boiled in a large pot of water. The water must measure at least 5 times in volume than the volume of uncooked rice. Doing so dilutes the starch and ensures that most of it gets drained out at the end, along with the water. (3) Once the rice is cooked to the desired softness, use a large strainer to remove the excess water. Letting the rice sit in the boiled, starchy water (or not draining off as much of the liquid as possible) will yield a sticky, mushy end product. (4) Sometimes, the iron content in the water tends to produce yellowish rice. For fluffy, white rice, you may add a tablespoon of vinegar or a teaspoon of _fitkari_ (alum) to the boiling pot. (5) Finally, as for boiling time, it will depend on the rice and water you use. Ours usually takes about 25 minutes. We highly recommend that you determine the cooking time for _your_ rice. Once you've done that, set a timer whenever you put a pot to boil. When the timer goes off, all you need to do is drain out the water, and you have perfectly cooked rice every single time.      \n\n***\n\n**TIME TAKEN** 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the rice and water you use\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient         |\n|----------|--------------------|\n|    1 cup | Rice               |\n|   5 cups | Water              |\n|   1 tbsp | Vinegar (optional) |\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot | saucepan\n- Lid for the boiling vessel\n- Large strainer | colander\n\n## Appliance\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1.

Grown in vast quantities in paddy fields across the region, rice is eaten in various forms—boiled, steamed, puffed, or beaten. While the keeper of the Bengali kitchen might break out the precious <em>gobindobhog</em> for <em>polao</em>, <em>payesh</em>, or <em>khichuri</em>, and the <em>basmati</em> for <em>biryani</em>, it is the <em>sheddho chal</em>, or parboiled rice, that is piled onto plates daily. <em>Sheddho chal</em> is named after the technique used to separate the grain from the husk. This process is said to enhance the nutritional profile of the rice and make it easier to digest.</p>\n<p>There is something extremely satisfying in sitting down to a meal before a plate of perfectly cooked, non-sticky, pearly-white, fluffy rice. While there are innumerable ways of boiling rice and there appears to be no set formula, keeping a few things in mind is useful. (1) Washing the rice thoroughly and repeatedly helps get rid of the starch that usually contributes to its stickiness. (2) Rice, like pasta, must be boiled in a large pot of water. The water must measure at least 5 times in volume than the volume of uncooked rice. Doing so dilutes the starch and ensures that most of it gets drained out at the end, along with the water. (3) Once the rice is cooked to the desired softness, use a large strainer to remove the excess water. Letting the rice sit in the boiled, starchy water (or not draining off as much of the liquid as possible) will yield a sticky, mushy end product. (4) Sometimes, the iron content in the water tends to produce yellowish rice. For fluffy, white rice, you may add a tablespoon of vinegar or a teaspoon of <em>fitkari</em> (alum) to the boiling pot.

Even though it looks very polished, it is a fairly easy recipe to execute. It requires few ingredients, no special technique, and very little time.\n\nIlish or hilsa is, however, is facing extinction due to high demand and overfishing. While policy initiatives between India and Bangladesh are underway to tackle this alarming situation (hilsa conservation depends a great deal on water flow in the Padma-Meghna and Hooghly-Bhagirathi river systems), we can do our bit too [[source]](http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/iucn_hilsa_study.pdf).\n\n** How can you help? **\n  1. Don't to buy any hilsa that is under 500 g / 25 cm. Catching of hilsa before the spawning stage is detrimental to the progression of the next generation. \n  2. It is equally important also to _not buy hilsa during the breeding season_ (especially October to November, but even better, until March).\n\n\nIn 2016, Bangaldesh was able to increase its hilsa yield by 50 per cent by putting measures in place to ban fishing in the breeding season. It also laid down and imposed specifications for net size to prevent the catching of juvenile hilsa. There is a need to create more consciousness about the importance of conserving a fish that is perhaps Bengal’s greatest cultural icon. \n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 40 minutes\n**YIELDS** 4 servings\n**CALORIES** 324 kcal per serving\n***\n## Ingredients\n|         Quantity | Ingredient                                  |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 280 g (or 4 pcs) | Ilish machh (hilsa fish, 3-cm-thick pieces) |\n|             40 g | Mustard seeds (soaked overnight)            |\n|            8 pcs | Green chillies                              |\n|             40 g | Coconut (peeled)                            |\n|             50 g | Yoghurt (beaten)                            |\n|             24 g | Salt                                        |\n|              2 g | Sugar                                       |\n|              2 g | Turmeric powder                             |\n|             20 g | Mustard oil                                 |\n\n## You will also need\n- Banana leaves (_kolapata_)\n- A spool of thin cotton string\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Flat pan | _tawa_\n- Lid for the _tawa_\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Grinder\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1.

Cut kachkola into 5-cm cross-sections and boil in a pressure cooker with 8 g salt, ¼ tsp turmeric, and 450 g water. On medium heat, one whistle should do the trick. Turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally. However, do not let the kachkola sit in the water for too long or it will absorb water and become soggy.","2. Remove the kachkola peels and transfer the boiled bananas to a mixing bowl. Add the boiled potato (80 g) and mash the two together until lump free.","3.

Add the grated coconut and fry it for about a minute. Be careful not to let the coconut burn.","10. Now add the spice slurry prepared earlier and sauté it on medium heat. Whenever the mixture dries out, add a splash of hot water and continue frying. Add the salt and 2 slit green green chillies, and after a couple of minutes add the sugar. Cover the pan and keep cooking the spices until oil separates and the potatoes are done (about 6 minutes).","11. Add 450 g hot water. This will form the curry. Once it comes to a boil, drop in the koftas. Simmer on low heat until the curry thickens. This should take about 5 minutes.","12.

Kachkola’r kofta are delicately spiced, deep-fried raw banana fritters. Boiled kachkola are mashed with boiled potatoes, onion paste, ginger, green chillies, and a host of dry spices including bhaja masala, which gives the koftas their distinctive flavour. A little maida (all-purpose flour) binds everything together. This mixture is then portioned, shaped into discs, and dropped in hot oil. We like to fry our kachkola’r boras until they are dark brown in colour (as opposed to golden brown). This leads to richer, better tasting koftas, which also don’t break as easily once introduced to the curry. This brings us to the second part of the recipe—the kachkola jhol/dalna. This raw banana or plantain curry is hot, gingery, and slightly sweet. The addition of grated coconut gives the curry body in addition to a nice texture. As always we finish this particular dalna too with some ghee and Bengali garam masala. \n\nThe green banana koftas, once fried and completely cooled, freeze very well.

Cut kachkola into 5-cm cross-sections and boil in a pressure cooker with 8 g salt, ¼ tsp turmeric, and 450 g water. On medium heat, one whistle should do the trick. Turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally. However, do not let the kachkola sit in the water for too long or it will absorb water and become soggy. \n2. Remove the kachkola peels and transfer the boiled bananas to a mixing bowl. Add the boiled potato (80 g) and mash the two together until lump free.\n3. Now add onion paste, ginger paste, grated coconut, green chillies, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric, [bhaja masala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGmCPwauVBs), salt, sugar, and maida. Mix everything until well combined.\n4. Divide in 30 g portions and shape into discs. \n5. Lower the koftas into hot (170°C) vegetable oil in a single layer. Fry them until they are dark brown in colour, turning them over often. This should take about 4 to 5 minutes. Drain from the oil and set aside.\n\n**STEP I—MAKE THE DALNA**\n1. Peel the potatoes and cut them into 3-cm cubes. Make a slurry of spices by mixing ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric, and kashmiri red chilli powder with 50 g water. Set aside.\n2. Heat mustard oil in a pan. Temper it with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds.\n3. Add the potatoes and fry them for about 4 minutes, stirring frequently, until they are golden.\n4. Add the grated coconut and fry it for about a minute. Be careful not to let the coconut burn.\n5. Now add the spice slurry prepared earlier and sauté it on medium heat. Whenever the mixture dries out, add a splash of hot water and continue frying. Add the salt and 2 slit green  green chillies, and after a couple of minutes add the sugar. Cover the pan and keep cooking the spices until oil separates and the potatoes are done (about 6 minutes).\n6. Add 450 g hot water. This will form the curry. Once it comes to a boil, drop in the koftas. Simmer on low heat until the curry thickens. This should take about 5 minutes.\n7. Garnish with ghee, [Bengali garam masala](/recipe/bengali-garam-masala/), and two more slit green chillies. Rest it covered for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)","source":"_posts/kachkola-kofta-dalna.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Kachkola’r Kofta’r Dalna\ntags:\n  - torkari\n  - vegetarian\n  - vegan\n  - gluten-free\ndescription: Bengali special spicy green plantain fritters soaked in a warm gingery curry\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1524195143/kachkolar-kofta-website-thumbnail_kramq4.png\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: qbZRmBc3y9M\ndate: 2018-04-19 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Kachkola’r Kofta’r Dalna\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1524195143/kachkolar-kofta-website-thumbnail_kramq4.png\",\"description\":\"Bengali special spicy green plantain fritters soaked in a warm gingery curry\",\"prepTime\":\"PT60M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT90M\",\"recipeYield\":\"8 servings\", \"nutrition\":{\"@type\":\"NutritionInformation\",\"servingSize\":\"8\",\"calories\":\"219 calories\"}, \"recipeIngredient\":[\"400 g Kachkola (unripe, green bananas)\",\"80 g Boiled potato\",\"45 g Onion paste\",\"10 g Ginger paste\",\"10 g Grated coconut\",\"2 pcs Green chillies (finely chopped)\",\"¾ tsp Cumin powder\",\"¾ tsp Coriander powder\",\"½ tsp Turmeric\",\"½ tsp Bhaja masala\",\"6 g Salt\",\"10 g Sugar\",\"20 g Maida\",\"~150 g Vegetable oil (for frying)\",\"150 g Potatoes (3cm cubes)\",\"25 g Grated coconut\",\"40 g Ginger paste\",\"4 g Cumin powder\",\"2 g Coriander powder\",\"3 g Turmeric\",\"½ tsp Kashmiri red chilli powder\",\"4 pcs Green chillies\",\"25 g Mustard oil\",\"3 pcs Dried red chillies\",\"3 pcs Bay leaves\",\"3 pcs Cardamom\",\"1 pc Cinnamon\",\"3 pcs Cloves\",\"½ tsp Cumin seeds\",\"14 g Salt\",\"20 g Sugar\",\"10 g Ghee\",\"¼ tsp Bengali garam masala\",\"450 g Hot water\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

Kachkola’r kofta are delicately spiced, deep-fried raw banana fritters. Boiled kachkola are mashed with boiled potatoes, onion paste, ginger, green chillies, and a host of dry spices including bhaja masala, which gives the koftas their distinctive flavour. A little maida (all-purpose flour) binds everything together. This mixture is then portioned, shaped into discs, and dropped in hot oil. We like to fry our kachkola’r boras until they are dark brown in colour (as opposed to golden brown). This leads to richer, better tasting koftas, which also don’t break as easily once introduced to the curry. This brings us to the second part of the recipe—the kachkola jhol/dalna. This raw banana or plantain curry is hot, gingery, and slightly sweet. The addition of grated coconut gives the curry body in addition to a nice texture. As always we finish this particular dalna too with some ghee and Bengali garam masala. \n\nThe green banana koftas, once fried and completely cooled, freeze very well. We usually make a large batch and freeze half for up to 30 days. Be sure to store them in an airtight box or bag.

Kachkola’r kofta are delicately spiced, deep-fried raw banana fritters. Boiled kachkola are mashed with boiled potatoes, onion paste, ginger, green chillies, and a host of dry spices including bhaja masala, which gives the koftas their distinctive flavour. A little maida (all-purpose flour) binds everything together. This mixture is then portioned, shaped into discs, and dropped in hot oil. We like to fry our kachkola’r boras until they are dark brown in colour (as opposed to golden brown). This leads to richer, better tasting koftas, which also don’t break as easily once introduced to the curry. This brings us to the second part of the recipe—the kachkola jhol/dalna. This raw banana or plantain curry is hot, gingery, and slightly sweet. The addition of grated coconut gives the curry body in addition to a nice texture. As always we finish this particular dalna too with some ghee and Bengali garam masala. </p>\n<p>The green banana koftas, once fried and completely cooled, freeze very well. We usually make a large batch and freeze half for up to 30 days. Be sure to store them in an airtight box or bag. The day before you want to make the curry, move them from the freezer to the fridge and let them defrost slowly.

Here ridged-gourds are stewed in a mild sauce with coconut, green chillies and nigella seeds. This is very easy to make and is perfect for summers when you don’t feel like eating anything rich. This recipe can be made with a combination of pumpkin and <em>jhinge</em> as well.</p>","more":"<p><span class=\"dropcap\">T</span>A <em>jhal</em> is a type of Bengali curry characterised by the sharpness of its flavours, unlike its close cousin, the jhol, which is usually more mellow. This recipe, kumro’r jhal, is defined by the heat and aroma that comes from freshly crushed green chillies and kaalo jeere (nigella seeds). In a way, the green chilli and kaalo jeere combination is a timeless one when it comes to Bengali cooking—these two work hand-in-hand to temper several classic dishes. In this recipe, these are not only used as phoron but they are also pasted and added to the curry itself. Apart from that, this unusual jhal recipe also makes use of coconut paste, some milk, and a pinch of flour, all of which render a light, yet creamy, gravy. This dish is extremely easy to make (it doesn’t require you to spend several minutes sauteing spices) and can be knocked out in under 30 minutes. </p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 25 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 5 servings<br><strong>CALORIES</strong> 107 kcal per serving</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>500 g</td>\n<td>Jhinge (ridged gourd)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pc</td>\n<td>Bay leaf</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pc</td>\n<td>Dried red chilli</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n<td>Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 pcs</td>\n<td>Green chillies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Coconut paste</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>40 g</td>\n<td>Milk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Maida (flour)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>150 g</td>\n<td>Water</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan</li>\n<li><em>Khhunti</em> | long frying spatula</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n<li>Mortar and pestle</li>\n<li><em>Sheel nora</em> | rolling pin</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Peel the ridges of the jhinge and cut it in 5 cm chunks.

Bring a pot of water to a boil.\n2. Lower the eggs (which should be at room temperature; eggs from the refrigerator might crack when added to boiling water) in the water and cook them on low heat for 6 minutes (duck eggs) or 5 minutes (chicken eggs), with the lid on.\n3. Turn off the heat and let the eggs sit in the hot water for another 3 minutes. We want the yolks gooey.\n4. Drain the water and remove the shells.\n5. Prick the eggs all around with a toothpick. This will prevent the eggs from bursting when fried and also allow the gravy to seep to the yolk.\n6. Coat the eggs in ¼ tsp each of salt and turmeric powder.\n7.

Peel and cut the potatoes in chunks of 5 cm. We need as many pieces of potatoes as there are eggs (four, in this case).\n2.

Alternatively, you can also boil them on the stove till partially cooked.\n4. Set aside.\n\n  **PART III—PREPARING THE CURRY**\n1. Now, heat 20 g mustard oil in a pan.\n2. Temper the oil with the _phoron_ (dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds).\n3. Once the whole spices start to crackle in oil, add the chopped onions and sugar to the pan and fry on medium heat for 5–7 minutes.\n4. Add the ginger paste and minced garlic to the pan, and fry for another 3–4 minutes.\n5. Make a spice paste by adding 50 g water to the cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and salt.\n6. Add this mixture to the pan and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n7. Then, add another 50g of water, along with the tomatoes and green chilli, and cook till the water dries off again.\n8. Add the parboiled potatoes and cook on low heat for 2 minutes.\n9. Then add the eggs. Cook for another minute. Stop here if you want _dim’er kosha_, a rich gravy to accompany your fried rice or _luchi_. For a lighter curry to eat with steamed rice, proceed to the next step.\n10. Now, add 225 g hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n11.

Bring a pot of water to a boil.\n2. Lower the eggs (which should be at room temperature; eggs from the refrigerator might crack when added to boiling water) in the water and cook them on low heat for 6 minutes (duck eggs) or 5 minutes (chicken eggs), with the lid on.\n3. Turn off the heat and let the eggs sit in the hot water for another 3 minutes. We want the yolks gooey.\n4. Drain the water and remove the shells.\n5. Prick the eggs all around with a toothpick. This will prevent the eggs from bursting when fried and also allow the gravy to seep to the yolk.\n6. Coat the eggs in ¼ tsp each of salt and turmeric powder.\n7. Fry the eggs in 10 g mustard oil on medium heat for 5 minutes, till they develop an even amber-coloured crust.\n8. Set aside.\n\n  **PART II—BOILING THE POTATOES**\n1. Peel and cut the potatoes in chunks of 5 cm. We need as many pieces of potatoes as there are eggs (four, in this case).\n2. Place them in a microwaveable bowl with 6 g of salt and 2 tablespoons of water.\n3. Cover with cling film and microwave for 3 minutes. Alternatively, you can also boil them on the stove till partially cooked.\n4. Set aside.\n\n  **PART III—PREPARING THE CURRY**\n1. Now, heat 20 g mustard oil in a pan.\n2. Temper the oil with the _phoron_ (dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds).\n3. Once the whole spices start to crackle in oil, add the chopped onions and sugar to the pan and fry on medium heat for 5–7 minutes.\n4. Add the ginger paste and minced garlic to the pan, and fry for another 3–4 minutes.\n5. Make a spice paste by adding 50 g water to the cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and salt.\n6. Add this mixture to the pan and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.\n7. Then, add another 50g of water, along with the tomatoes and green chilli, and cook till the water dries off again.\n8. Add the parboiled potatoes and cook on low heat for 2 minutes.\n9. Then add the eggs. Cook for another minute. Stop here if you want _dim’er kosha_, a rich gravy to accompany your fried rice or _luchi_. For a lighter curry to eat with steamed rice, proceed to the next step.\n10. Now, add 225 g hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n11.

Soak mustard seeds in water for 2 hours.","2. Clean the ilish machh and cut it in 3-cm thick slices. Ilish bhaape is best made with thick slices of fish. Fish without roe (eggs) is fattier and, therefore, ideal for this recipe. If your fish has eggs, remove them, as they may not cook fully when steamed. You can add them to your bhaja (fry) or jhol (curry).","3. Drain the mustard seeds of the water they’ve been soaking in and add them to a grinder jar. Add 4 green chillies, roughly chopped, along with the salt and 100g water. Grinding green chillies with the mustard ensures that it doesn’t turn bitter.","4. Grind these to a fine paste. Take your time with this process. Scrape down the sides of the jar and grind as many times as it takes to form the smoothest possible paste. The finer the grind, the better the flavours.","5. Now, add the peeled and chopped coconut to the grinder jar. Grind once again until the coconut has broken down completely.","6. Transfer this paste to a steel tiffin box. Add beaten yoghurt, sugar, turmeric, and mustard oil. Mix until the oil is fully incorporated.","7. Now add the fish, one piece at a time, and coat it with the spices. Use your hands to make sure every part of the fish, including its cavities, is well coated.","8. Slit four more green chillies and place them on the ilish pieces.","9. Fasten the lid of your tiffin box (you could also seal the top with thick aluminium foil) and set the fish aside to marinate for 15 minutes.","10. Heat up your pan and place a stand at the bottom. Pour hot water, making sure it doesn’t reach up to more than half the height of your tiffin box, or there’s a danger of water seeping in. Once the water has come to a boil, place the tiffin on the stand. Cover the pan and steam on medium heat for 15 minutes.","11.

You can keep everything ready in a tiffin box, and just as the guests are sitting down for the first course you can put the container to steam.

Soak mustard seeds in water for 2 hours.\n2. Clean the _ilish machh_ and cut it in 3-cm thick slices. Ilish bhaape is best made with thick slices of fish. Fish without roe (eggs) is fattier and, therefore, ideal for this recipe. If your fish has eggs, remove them, as they may not cook fully when steamed. You can add them to your bhaja (fry) or jhol (curry).\n3. Drain the mustard seeds of the water they’ve been soaking in and add them to a grinder jar. Add 4 green chillies, roughly chopped, along with the salt and 100g water. Grinding green chillies with the mustard ensures that it doesn’t turn bitter. \n4. Grind these to a fine paste. Take your time with this process. Scrape down the sides of the jar and grind as many times as it takes to form the smoothest possible paste. The finer the grind, the better the flavours.\n5. Now, add the peeled and chopped coconut to the grinder jar. Grind once again until the coconut has broken down completely. \n6. Transfer this paste to a steel tiffin box. Add beaten yoghurt, sugar, turmeric, and mustard oil. Mix until the oil is fully incorporated. \n7. Now add the fish, one piece at a time, and coat it with the spices. Use your hands to make sure every part of the fish, including its cavities, is well coated. \n8. Slit four more green chillies and place them on the ilish pieces.\n9. Fasten the lid of your tiffin box (you could also seal the top with thick aluminium foil) and set the fish aside to marinate for 15 minutes.\n10. Heat up your pan and place a stand at the bottom. Pour hot water, making sure it doesn’t reach up to more than half the height of your tiffin box, or there’s a danger of water seeping in. Once the water has come to a boil, place the tiffin on the stand. Cover the pan and steam on medium heat for 15 minutes. \n11. Remove from the pan and allow it to rest for another 5 minutes before serving.\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- [Polao](/recipe/mishti-polao/)","source":"_posts/ilish-bhapa.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Ilish Bhapa\ntags:\n- hilsa\n- fish\n- non-vegetarian\n- gluten-free\n- mustard\n\ndescription: >-\n  This prized Bengali recipe for hilsa steamed in mustard sauce looks gorgeous, but cooks quickly.

There is a need to create more consciousness about the importance of conserving a fish that is perhaps Bengal’s greatest cultural icon.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/iucn_hilsa_study.pdf\">http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/iucn_hilsa_study.pdf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/806667/how-king-hilsa-made-a-comeback\">https://scroll.in/article/806667/how-king-hilsa-made-a-comeback</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/india-bangladesh-seek-to-save-the-delectable-hilsa-113062700390_1.html\">http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/india-bangladesh-seek-to-save-the-delectable-hilsa-113062700390_1.html</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 40 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 4 servings<br><strong>CALORIES</strong> 300 kcal per serving</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>250 g (or 4 pcs)</td>\n<td>Ilish machh (hilsa fish, 3-cm-thick pieces)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>40 g</td>\n<td>Mustard seeds (brown + yellow mixed, soaked for 2 hours)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8 pcs</td>\n<td>Green chillies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>40 g</td>\n<td>Coconut (peeled)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25 g</td>\n<td>Yoghurt (beaten)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n<td>Turmeric powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | large pot or pan (with lid)</li>\n<li>Steel tiffin box with tight-fitting lid</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Grinder</li>\n<li>Stove</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Soak mustard seeds in water for 2 hours.</li>\n<li>Clean the <em>ilish machh</em> and cut it in 3-cm thick slices. Ilish bhaape is best made with thick slices of fish. Fish without roe (eggs) is fattier and, therefore, ideal for this recipe. If your fish has eggs, remove them, as they may not cook fully when steamed. You can add them to your bhaja (fry) or jhol (curry).</li>\n<li>Drain the mustard seeds of the water they’ve been soaking in and add them to a grinder jar. Add 4 green chillies, roughly chopped, along with the salt and 100g water. Grinding green chillies with the mustard ensures that it doesn’t turn bitter. </li>\n<li>Grind these to a fine paste. Take your time with this process. Scrape down the sides of the jar and grind as many times as it takes to form the smoothest possible paste. The finer the grind, the better the flavours.</li>\n<li>Now, add the peeled and chopped coconut to the grinder jar. Grind once again until the coconut has broken down completely. </li>\n<li>Transfer this paste to a steel tiffin box. Add beaten yoghurt, sugar, turmeric, and mustard oil. Mix until the oil is fully incorporated. </li>\n<li>Now add the fish, one piece at a time, and coat it with the spices. Use your hands to make sure every part of the fish, including its cavities, is well coated. </li>\n<li>Slit four more green chillies and place them on the ilish pieces.</li>\n<li>Fasten the lid of your tiffin box (you could also seal the top with thick aluminium foil) and set the fish aside to marinate for 15 minutes.</li>\n<li>Heat up your pan and place a stand at the bottom. Pour hot water, making sure it doesn’t reach up to more than half the height of your tiffin box, or there’s a danger of water seeping in. Once the water has come to a boil, place the tiffin on the stand. Cover the pan and steam on medium heat for 15 minutes. </li>\n<li>Remove from the pan and allow it to rest for another 5 minutes before serving.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Served-with\"><a href=\"#Served-with\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Served with\"></a>Served with</h2><ul>\n<li><a href=\"/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/\">Rice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/recipe/mishti-polao/\">Polao</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"title":"Jhuri Alu Bhaja","description":"A step-by-step recipe that walks you through the process of making the perfectly fine, crisp, golden potato fries every single time.","thumbnailImagePosition":"top","thumbnailImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1489113508/jhuri-alu-bhaja-website-thumb_wyukv1.jpg","coverMeta":"out","coverSize":"partial","videoId":"HJOm7zMTRX0","date":"2017-03-09T17:00:00.000Z","jsonLd":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Recipe","name":"Jhuri Alu Bhaja","author":"Bong Eats","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1489113508/jhuri-alu-bhaja-website-thumb_wyukv1.jpg","description":"A step-by-step recipe that walks you through the process of making the perfectly fine, crisp, golden potato fries every single time.","prepTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT50M","recipeYield":"4 eggs","recipeIngredient":["Potatoes 400 g","Peanuts 25 g","Curry leaves 1 sprig","Bay leaves 1 piece","Vegetable oil (for frying) 500 g","Pepper (crushed) ¼ tsp","Salt\t¼ tsp","Rock salt ¼ tsp","Chaat masala ¼ tsp","Red chilli powder 1 pinch"],"recipeInstructions":["1 Using a slicer, cut the potatoes into 2-mm-thick slices.

Using a slicer, cut the potatoes into 2-mm-thick slices. Alternatively, you can also use a sharp knife cut thin slices by hand. Reserve the slices in a large bowl of water to prevent the potatoes from oxidizing.\n2. Wash the potato slices in plenty of water to remove the starch. Doing so will allow the _alu bhaja_ to crisp up nicely. Change the water 2–3 times during this process to make sure that most of the starch is gone. Drain the water when done.\n3. Now, lay out absorbent towels on a surface and spread out the washed potato slices in a single layer. We want the potatoes to be completely dry before we move on to the next stage—moisture will make the fries limp. Take your time. Dab them with another towel, or let them air dry for long as it takes for them to be completely dry.\n4. Bunch together 5–6 slices at a time, and chop them into matchsticks, 2-mm-wide.\n5. Heat about 500 g vegetable oil in a pan. The secret to non-greasy fries is to use a lot of oil. The excessive amount of oil will allow the potato juliennes to float freely, rather than lump together and trap steam. The temperature of the oil is also important for this recipe. It should be adequately hot (at around 180°C), but should never reach the smoking point.\n6. Once the oil is hot, fry the peanuts for 20 seconds, drain, and reserve for later. Do the same with the curry leaves, frying them for 10 seconds.\n7. Now, drop a small handful of potatoes into the oil. It is important not to overcrowd the pan. When the potatoes hit the oil, they will release a lot of steam. With time, the bubbles will gradually start subsiding (in about 3 minutes or so). The process of frying essentially serves to dehydrate the potatoes—and _that_ is what lets them turn crisp, and stay crisp, longer. When the moisture has evaporated as steam bubbles, you know that the _alu bhaja_ is crunchy. Fry for another 2 minutes for it to develop colour.\n7. Strain the _alu bhaja_ from the oil, and transfer to a perforated vessel (such as a colander or wicker basket) to cool. A basket allows the remaining steam to get out. Otherwise the steam will condense into water as the fries cool, making them limp.\n8. Garnish with the fried peanuts and curry leaves.\n9. FOR THE SEASONING, mix together the freshly ground pepper, salt, rock salt, chaat masala, and red chilli powder in the given proportions. Sprinkle this mix on the _alu bhaja_ just before eating.

Three important things need to be kept in mind: (1) The cut potatoes should be washed in plenty of water to rid them of starch; (2) before frying, the potatoes must be thoroughly dried—any moisture will yield limp fries; and (3) the potato juliennes must be fried in a pan full of oil, at a steady temperature of 180°C (that is, the oil should be hot, but not so hot that it begins to smoke).</p>\n\n<p>Without further ado, let’s get into the step-by-step guide to making the perfectly crisp <em>jhuri alu bhaja</em> every single time.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 45 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 8 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>400 g</td>\n<td>Potatoes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25 g</td>\n<td>Peanuts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 sprig</td>\n<td>Curry leaves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>500 g</td>\n<td>Vegetable oil (for frying)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Pepper (crushed)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Rock salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Chaat masala</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pinch</td>\n<td>Red chilli powder</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Any good slicer</li>\n<li>Sharp knife</li>\n<li>2–3 clean, absorbent towels</li>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan</li>\n<li>Frying spoon | perforated spoon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Using a slicer, cut the potatoes into 2-mm-thick slices. Alternatively, you can also use a sharp knife cut thin slices by hand. Reserve the slices in a large bowl of water to prevent the potatoes from oxidizing.</li>\n<li>Wash the potato slices in plenty of water to remove the starch. Doing so will allow the <em>alu bhaja</em> to crisp up nicely. Change the water 2–3 times during this process to make sure that most of the starch is gone. Drain the water when done.</li>\n<li>Now, lay out absorbent towels on a surface and spread out the washed potato slices in a single layer. We want the potatoes to be completely dry before we move on to the next stage—moisture will make the fries limp. Take your time. Dab them with another towel, or let them air dry for long as it takes for them to be completely dry.</li>\n<li>Bunch together 5–6 slices at a time, and chop them into matchsticks, 2-mm-wide.</li>\n<li>Heat about 500 g vegetable oil in a pan. The secret to non-greasy fries is to use a lot of oil. The excessive amount of oil will allow the potato juliennes to float freely, rather than lump together and trap steam. The temperature of the oil is also important for this recipe. It should be adequately hot (at around 180°C), but should never reach the smoking point.</li>\n<li>Once the oil is hot, fry the peanuts for 20 seconds, drain, and reserve for later. Do the same with the curry leaves, frying them for 10 seconds.</li>\n<li>Now, drop a small handful of potatoes into the oil. It is important not to overcrowd the pan. When the potatoes hit the oil, they will release a lot of steam. With time, the bubbles will gradually start subsiding (in about 3 minutes or so). The process of frying essentially serves to dehydrate the potatoes—and <em>that</em> is what lets them turn crisp, and stay crisp, longer. When the moisture has evaporated as steam bubbles, you know that the <em>alu bhaja</em> is crunchy. Fry for another 2 minutes for it to develop colour.</li>\n<li>Strain the <em>alu bhaja</em> from the oil, and transfer to a perforated vessel (such as a colander or wicker basket) to cool. A basket allows the remaining steam to get out. Otherwise the steam will condense into water as the fries cool, making them limp.</li>\n<li>Garnish with the fried peanuts and curry leaves.</li>\n<li>FOR THE SEASONING, mix together the freshly ground pepper, salt, rock salt, chaat masala, and red chilli powder in the given proportions. Sprinkle this mix on the <em>alu bhaja</em> just before eating. Salt, being hygroscopic, tends to absorb moisture from the air, and turn the crisps soggy. Without the seasoning, the <em>alu bhaja</em> should keep for up to 7 days in an airtight container.  </li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Served-with\"><a href=\"#Served-with\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Served with\"></a>Served with</h2><ul>\n<li><a href=\"/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/\">Rice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/tags/dal/\">Dal</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"title":"Ilish Machh’er Tel Jhol","description":"A hearty Bengali Ilish (Hilsa) curry that takes just six ingredients and 30 minutes to cook.","thumbnailImagePosition":"top","thumbnailImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1502409865/ilish-tel-jhol-website-thumbnail-_copy_fgqkru.jpg","coverMeta":"out","coverSize":"partial","videoId":"eozV_33nz7c","date":"2017-08-09T03:30:00.000Z","jsonLd":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Recipe","name":"Ilish Macher Jhol","author":"Bong Eats","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1502409865/ilish-tel-jhol-website-thumbnail-_copy_fgqkru.jpg","description":"A hearty Bengali Ilish (Hilsa) curry that takes just six ingredients and 30 minutes to cook.","prepTime":"PT5M","totalTime":"PT30M","recipeYield":"5","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"5 servings","calories":"339 calories","fatContent":"19.4 g","carbohydrateContent":"7.3 g","proteinContent":"21.8 g"},"recipeIngredient":["500 g Ilish machh (hilsa fish, 3-cm-thick pieces)","100 g Brinjal (5cm chunks)","40 g Mustard oil (for cooking and garnish)","5 pcs Green chillies (slit)","¼ tsp Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)","18 g Salt","6 g Turmeric powder","¼ tsp Atta (flour)","350 g Hot water"],"recipeInstructions":["1.

In a bowl, add the yoghurt, chopped mint leaves, bhaja masala, 2 g salt, and 5 g sugar. Beat together till everything is well combined.\n2. Cover and leave it in the refrigerator to chill.\n\n**STEP II—PREPARE THE KOFTAS**\n1. Set a pan on medium heat and add 15 g vegetable oil to it.\n2. Once the oil is hot, add 60 g of the finely chopped onions. Fry till they turn golden in colour (about 5 minutes).\n3. Add 2 green chillies, finely chopped, and fry them for another minute.\n4. Next, add the minced meat. Using your spatula, break up the lumps in the mince.\n5. Stir in 5 g of salt and 1 tsp of [Shahi garam masala powder](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/) powder.\n6. Cover and cook the mince on medium heat, till it is tender, for about 6 minutes (if using beef keema), or 15 minutes (if using mutton keema).\n7. If your mince is particularly fatty, scoop out the excess rendered fat till the keema appears dry.\n8. Transfer the cooked mince to a grinder jar and blitz in short pulses till it is completely smooth. Since the keema is dry, this process might take some time and patience. Scrape down the sides of the jar every so often and pulse again till smooth.\n9. Once the mince is perfectly ground, transfer it to a mixing bowl.\n10. Add the boiled potatoes and mash them in.\n11. Also add half a beaten egg, 2 chopped green chillies, and 25 g chopped onions. Combine everything until you have a dough-like mixture.\n12. Portion the mixture into 12 balls, each weighing 30 g. Press each ball in your fist to compact the ground mince. Then, roll it between your palms to form a smooth, crack-free ball.\n13. In a frying pan, heat vegetable oil, about 4-cm deep.\n14. Fry the balls till they are brown. Since the mince is already cooked, these koftas brown very quickly (in under a minute), so be prepared to extract them from the oil accordingly.\n15. Drain from the oil and set aside.\n\n**STEP III—ASSEMBLY**\n1. Melt some ghee in the microwave or on the stove. Get the yoghurt mixture out of the fridge.\n2. In individual serving bowls, add the fried koftas. Drizzle some melted ghee on them. Top with generous portions of the beaten yoghurt mixture and a few dollops of tamarind sauce. Garnish with some chopped mint leaves, and serve immediately. (Remember that while serving, the boras should be hot, and the yoghurt, cold.)\n","slug":"keemar-doi-bora","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-30T02:29:02.525Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjqrmmt6y0037yovh9am95i0y","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">Warm minced-meat <em>koftas</em> topped with a generous helping of chilled, spiced yoghurt</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">The sub-continent’s favourite snack with a deliciously meaty twist.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">I</span>t is impossible to overstate the impact of the Tagore family on the Bengali way of life.

Chopping off the root will ensure that each strand separates from the rest.","Heat vegetable oil, 3 cm deep, on medium heat. Once hot, drop a handful of the onion slices. Be sure not to overcrowd the pan; the onions must fry in a single layer.","Using a fork, move the onions around every so often so that they fry evenly.","Just as the onions start to turn golden (do not wait until they have already turned golden), start removing them from the pan and draining them over a perforated vessel such as a colander or jhuri. Keep a close watch, as the onions tend to burn very quickly towards the end. Remove them from the oil before they have taken on the desired colour; they will continue to cook in the residual heat.","Allow them to cool and crisp up. This caramelised onion is called birasta and it is used in several Mughlai preparations. Raw onions weighing 650 g should yield about 165 g birasta (so about 25 per cent the weight of raw onions). It can be stored in an airtight container for 2 to 3 weeks.","Using a grinder or mortar and pestle, form a smooth paste of 15 g ginger, 10 g garlic, and 10 g green chillies.

Add 1.5 kg of water, close the lid, and pressure cook for about 1 hour. The meat should be completely soft by this stage, such that it easily falls off the bone.","Pick out the meat pieces from the pressure cooker. Just as they are cool enough to handle, remove the bones, cartilage, and any hard, unrendered collagen that is still in the meat. Discard these, along with the bay leaves.","You should now be left with a gorgeous meaty broth, and some boneless pieces of tender meat. At this stage, you can put the meat and broth in the fridge and complete the rest of the preparation the following day.","Chop the meat, against the grain, into 3-cm chunks. Chilling the meat before chopping hardens the collagen rendered from the meat, making it easy to cut into cubes.","Divide the meat into two piles. The first will be ground along with the grains, and the second added whole to the haleem towards the end.","Strain the water from the soaked grains, and transfer the latter to a heavy-bottomed pan. Add the broth we prepared earlier to the pan.

Boiling the grains in the broth rather than in water intensifies the meaty flavour of the dish.","Transfer the boiled grains into a blender and grind till everything breaks down. However, be careful not to reduce everything to a uniform, smooth paste, as we want some semblance of texture. Depending on the size of your blender jar, you may have to do this in batches.","Return the haleem to the pan. Add the remaining chunks of meat, along with 650 g hot milk. Mix until uniform. Bring to a boil before turning off the heat.","For the garnish, julienne some ginger, cut limes into wedges, split green chillies lengthwise, and finely chop the mint leaves.","Drop ladles of the haleem into a serving dish. Top it with a generous amount of birasta and chopped mint leaves.","Heat a pan till it is extremely hot. Add a spoonful of ghee and wait for it to smoke. Then add some julienned ginger and split green chillies.

By some accounts, Calcutta is estimated to have under 5,000 'Bohris'. Mostly traders and businessfolk, the earliest settlers arrived in the city from western parts of India in the late 1800s</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">K</span>_hichro_ is a typically Bohra Muslim preparation. Like the more popular _haleem_ found in Calcutta during Ramzan, _khichro_ is made by slowly cooking meat and grains together till the meat falls off the bone. _Khichro_ is a special dish, being most prominently consumed communally on the tenth day of Muharram by Bohras across the globe, but it is also a very homely preparation, eaten throughout the year. It is deceptively light. In spite of the fact that a lot of onions, spices, meat, milk, and ghee goes into the dish, it is, underneath all that, a very hearty porridge of various kinds of grains. The _khichro_ is distinctive in that it is pale in colour; it doesn’t make use of turmeric powder, chilli powder, jeera powder, and other such spices. Apart from meat, its main ingredient is broken wheat (dalia can also be used), whereas _haleem_ is made predominantly with a mixture of dals.\n\n| Day 1                             | Day 2                        |  \n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Soaking grains                    | Chopping meat                |\n| Making _birasta_                  | Cooking grains               |\n| Cooking meat                      | Blending everything together |\n| Separating meat, stock, and bones | Garnishing                   |\n\n\n**COOKING TIME** 5 hours   \n**YIELDS** 6 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|         Quantity | Ingredient                            |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|       **GRAINS** |                                       |\n|            180 g | Broken wheat or dalia                 |\n|             30 g | Masoor dal                            |\n|             30 g | Moong dal                             |\n|             30 g | Chhola’r dal                          |\n|             30 g | Rice                                  |\n| **FOR THE MEAT** |                                       |\n|            800 g | Beef (or any red meat of your choice) |\n|             1 kg | Onions                                |\n|             15 g | Ginger                                |\n|             10 g | Garlic                                |\n|             10 g | Green chillies                        |\n|            6 pcs | Cardamom (whole)                      |\n|            2 pcs | Cinnamon (whole)                      |\n|            6 pcs | Cloves (whole)                        |\n|           10 pcs | Peppercorns                           |\n|            2 pcs | Bay leaves                            |\n|              3 g | [Shahi garam masala powder](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/)             |\n|             33 g | Salt                                  |\n|      **LIQUIDS** |                                       |\n|           1.5 kg | Water                                 |\n|            650 g | Milk                                  |\n|          **FAT** |                                       |\n|            250 g | Vegetable oil                         |\n|             50 g | Ghee                                  |\n|      **GARNISH** |                                       |\n|          1 bunch | Mint leaves                           |\n|             40 g | Ginger                                |\n|        12 wedges | Lime                                  |\n|            6 pcs | Green chillies                        |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Large dish or pot (for soaking grains)\n- Heavy-bottomed boiling pot with lid\n- Pressure cooker\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- _Khhunti_ | long stapula\n- _Jhhajhhri_ | perforated frying spoon\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Grinder\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—SOAKING GRAINS**\n1. Take the broken wheat, dals, and rice in a bowl. Rinse them well and soak overnight, for at least 12 hours.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING ONIONS (_BIRASTA_)**\n1. Slice 650g onions thinly, cutting off the root that holds the bulb together.\n2. Using you hand, scrunch up the slices to separate each layer. Chopping off the root will ensure that each strand separates from the rest.\n3. Heat vegetable oil, 3 cm deep, on medium heat. Once hot, drop a handful of the onion slices. Be sure not to overcrowd the pan; the onions must fry in a single layer.\n4. Using a fork, move the onions around every so often so that they fry evenly.\n5. Just as the onions start to turn golden (do not wait until they have already turned golden), start removing them from the pan and draining them over a perforated vessel such as a colander or _jhuri_. Keep a close watch, as the onions tend to burn very quickly towards the end. Remove them from the oil _before_ they have taken on the desired colour; they will continue to cook in the residual heat.\n6. Allow them to cool and crisp up. This caramelised onion is called _birasta_ and it is used in several Mughlai preparations. Raw onions weighing 650 g should yield about 165 g _birasta_ (so about 25 per cent the weight of raw onions). It can be stored in an airtight container for 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n**STEP III—COOKING MEAT**\n1. Using a grinder or mortar and pestle, form a smooth paste of 15 g ginger, 10 g garlic, and 10 g green chillies. Set aside.\n2. In a _kadai_, heat 35 g vegetable oil. Once hot, fry the meat in batches, from all sides, till it is golden. Browning the meat enhances the flavour of the dish.\n3. Remove from the pan and set aside.\n4. Temper the same oil with bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns.\n5. Add 350 g sliced onions, along with 15 g salt. Stirring intermittently, fry on medium heat for about 10 minutes till the onions turn brown.\n6. Next, add in the ginger-garlic-green-chilli paste and fry for another 3 minutes, until the smell of the raw spices is gone.\n7. Add [_Shahi garam masala_](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/) powder and 35 g of the _birasta_ we prepared earlier. Using a combination of sautéed and caramelised onions adds a depth of flavour to the preparation.\n8. Add the browned pieces of meat to the onion mixture and sauté for about 2 minutes.\n10. Transfer everything from the _kadai_ to a pressure cooker. Add 1.5 kg of water, close the lid, and pressure cook for about 1 hour. The meat should be completely soft by this stage, such that it easily falls off the bone.\n\n**STEP IV—SEPARATING MEAT, BROTH, AND BONES**\n1. Pick out the meat pieces from the pressure cooker. Just as they are cool enough to handle, remove the bones, cartilage, and any hard, unrendered collagen that is still in the meat. Discard these, along with the bay leaves.\n2. You should now be left with a gorgeous meaty broth, and some boneless pieces of tender meat. At this stage, you can put the meat and broth in the fridge and complete the rest of the preparation the following day.\n\n**STEP V—CHOPPING MEAT**\n1. Chop the meat, against the grain, into 3-cm chunks. Chilling the meat before chopping hardens the collagen rendered from the meat, making it easy to cut into cubes.\n2. Divide the meat into two piles. The first will be ground along with the grains, and the second added whole to the haleem towards the end.\n\n**STEP VI—BOILING GRAINS**\n1. Strain the water from the soaked grains, and transfer the latter to a heavy-bottomed pan. Add the broth we prepared earlier to the pan. (If you placed the broth in the fridge overnight, do not forget to first bring it to  boil before adding it to the grains.)\n2. Also add 18 g of salt and the first pile of the chopped meat.\n3. On low heat, let it all bubble for at least one hour, stirring occasionally, till the the grains are soft. Boiling the grains in the broth rather than in water intensifies the meaty flavour of the dish.\n\n**STEP VII—BLENDING EVERYTHING**\n1. Transfer the boiled grains into a blender and grind till everything breaks down. However, be careful not to reduce everything to a uniform, smooth paste, as we want some semblance of texture. Depending on the size of your blender jar, you may have to do this in batches.\n2. Return the _haleem_ to the pan. Add the remaining chunks of meat, along with 650 g hot milk. Mix until uniform. Bring to a boil before turning off the heat.\n\n**STEP VIII—GARNISHING**\n1. For the garnish, julienne some ginger, cut limes into wedges, split green chillies lengthwise, and finely chop the mint leaves.\n2. Drop ladles of the _haleem_ into a serving dish. Top it with a generous amount of _birasta_ and chopped mint leaves.\n3. Heat a pan till it is extremely hot. Add a spoonful of ghee and wait for it to smoke. Then add some julienned ginger and split green chillies. Fry for about 5 seconds and pour the contents of the pan (along with the ghee) over the serving dish.\n\n\n## Served with\n- Bread rolls\n","source":"_posts/khichra-bohra-haleem.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Khichra—Bohra-Style Haleem\ntags:\n  - snack\n  - street food\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - ramzan recipe\n  - bohra recipe\ndescription: >-\n  Khichra, the Bohri version of haleem, is hearty dish is made by stewing meat, wheat and pulses.

By some accounts, Calcutta is estimated to have under 5,000 'Bohris'. Mostly traders and businessfolk, the earliest settlers arrived in the city from western parts of India in the late 1800s</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">K</span>_hichro_ is a typically Bohra Muslim preparation. Like the more popular _haleem_ found in Calcutta during Ramzan, _khichro_ is made by slowly cooking meat and grains together till the meat falls off the bone. _Khichro_ is a special dish, being most prominently consumed communally on the tenth day of Muharram by Bohras across the globe, but it is also a very homely preparation, eaten throughout the year. It is deceptively light. In spite of the fact that a lot of onions, spices, meat, milk, and ghee goes into the dish, it is, underneath all that, a very hearty porridge of various kinds of grains.

Chop the meat, against the grain, into 3-cm chunks. Chilling the meat before chopping hardens the collagen rendered from the meat, making it easy to cut into cubes.\n2. Divide the meat into two piles. The first will be ground along with the grains, and the second added whole to the haleem towards the end.\n\n**STEP VI—BOILING GRAINS**\n1. Strain the water from the soaked grains, and transfer the latter to a heavy-bottomed pan. Add the broth we prepared earlier to the pan. (If you placed the broth in the fridge overnight, do not forget to first bring it to  boil before adding it to the grains.)\n2. Also add 18 g of salt and the first pile of the chopped meat.\n3. On low heat, let it all bubble for at least one hour, stirring occasionally, till the the grains are soft. Boiling the grains in the broth rather than in water intensifies the meaty flavour of the dish.\n\n**STEP VII—BLENDING EVERYTHING**\n1. Transfer the boiled grains into a blender and grind till everything breaks down. However, be careful not to reduce everything to a uniform, smooth paste, as we want some semblance of texture. Depending on the size of your blender jar, you may have to do this in batches.\n2. Return the _haleem_ to the pan. Add the remaining chunks of meat, along with 650 g hot milk. Mix until uniform. Bring to a boil before turning off the heat.\n\n**STEP VIII—GARNISHING**\n1. For the garnish, julienne some ginger, cut limes into wedges, split green chillies lengthwise, and finely chop the mint leaves.\n2. Drop ladles of the _haleem_ into a serving dish. Top it with a generous amount of _birasta_ and chopped mint leaves.\n3. Heat a pan till it is extremely hot. Add a spoonful of ghee and wait for it to smoke. Then add some julienned ginger and split green chillies. Fry for about 5 seconds and pour the contents of the pan (along with the ghee) over the serving dish.\n\n\n## Served with\n- Bread rolls\n","slug":"khichra-bohra-haleem","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-17T06:35:22.907Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjqrmmt71003ayovhgqviezjs","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A slow-cooked stew of meat, grains, and pulses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Of the many migrant communities that make up the rich tapestry of Calcutta’s modern history, the Bohra Muslims might not be the most visible, but they are a thriving culture.

Smear the koi machh with ¾ tsp each of salt and turmeric till they are evenly coated. Set them aside.","2. Cut a cauliflower into chunky florets, about 5 cm large. Take as many florets as there are pieces of fish (in this case, five).","3. Peel and cut the potatoes lengthwise. Again, we need as many pieces of potatoes as there are fish.","4. Chop the tomato into quarters.","5. Heat a kadai till it is completely hot. Drizzle 30 g mustard oil into the pan till it starts smoking lightly, and changes colour from deep to pale yellow.","6. Add all the dal’er bori into the oil and fry them till they are golden. This should take about 15–20 seconds.","7. Remove the fried bori from the pan and set aside.","8. Now, add the cauliflower florets, along with ¼ tsp of salt, to the pan and fry them till they develop a light-brown colour. This should take about 4 minutes in all.","9. Remove the cauliflower from the pan and set aside.","10. Finally, add the marinated koi machh to the same oil, one at a time, and fry them for no longer than a minute on each side. Freshwater fish such as the koi benefit from a light fry, rather than a crusty one. So be sure not to sear the fish too much.","11. Remove the fish from the pan and set aside.","12. You now have fried bori, fried cauliflower, and fried fish ready for use at a later stage, and can now move on to the preparation of the curry.","13. At this point, inspect the oil in your pan. If it looks too burnt, replace it with 10 g of fresh mustard oil. If it is alright, use the same oil to cook the curry in as it contains all the flavour from the fried fish.","14. Temper the oil, set on medium heat, with the bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin seeds, and 2 slit green chillies.","15. Add the potatoes to the pan and fry them, with the lid on, for 4 minutes.","16. While the potatoes are frying, make a paste by combining cumin powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, salt, sugar, and 50 g water.","17. Add this mixture into the pan and fry it, with lid on, till the water dries up.","18. Now, add in the ginger paste and tomatoes, and incorporate them with the spices. Introduce another 50 g water to the pan and sauté the spices again till the water dries off.","19. The key here is to cover and cook because, alongside sautéing the spices, we also want to allow time for the potatoes to become tender.","20. Add in the fried cauliflower florets, fold them into the spices, and cook them for a minute or so.","21. Now, add 350 g of hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.","22. Once it comes to a boil, add in the fried bori, fried fish, and two (more) of the slit green chillies.","23. Using a spoon, gently try and submerge the fish in the curry. Be delicate as the fish is quite fragile at this stage.","24. Cover the pan and allow the curry to simmer for about 6 minutes.","25. Chop fresh coriander and add it to the pan. Let it simmer in the curry for another minute before turning off the heat."]},"_content":"\n\n\n<p class=\"post-byline\">Everyone’s favourite _machh’er jhol_ for the winter months</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">This is a light curry of the climbing perch fish (_koi machh_) and fried cauliflower florets.</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">K</span>_oi machh_ is a delicacy in Bengali cooking. Also known as the climbing perch fish because of its ability _climb_ out of water and walk on land for short distances, _koi machh_ is _always_ bought live at fish markets. It has an extremely slippery exterior, making the use of ash rather necessary while handling the fish for cleaning. Even if the _koi machh_ is scaled, degilled, and cleaned by your fish-seller, it might still be quite slimy to the touch. At home, you may need to rub the fish against an abrasive surface to get rid of the slipperiness (a perforated, steel colander-plate does this job quite well).\n\nComing to this recipe, its main ingredients, _koi machh_ and _phulkopi_ (cauliflower), are fried separately to enhance their flavours, and then added to the delicious _jhol_. The _jhol_ itself is a hot, gingery, _garam-masala_-infused curry that is mildly sweet, but never too spicy. It uplifts the taste of anything it gets soaked up in—potatoes, cauliflower, _bori_, or the fish. Eaten with a generous helping of steaming hot rice, this dish, the _phulkopi diye koi machh’er jhol_ is the Bengali’s favourite fish curry for the winter months.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 40 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|                         Quantity | Ingredient                        |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                             30 g | Mustard oil (for frying)          |\n|                             10 g | Mustard oil (for cooking)         |\n|              350 g (or 5 pieces) | Koi machh (climbing perch fish)   |\n|              150 g (or 5 pieces) | Cauliflower (5-cm florets)        |\n|              100 g (or 5 pieces) | Potatoes (cut lengthwise)         |\n|                        10 pieces | Dal’er bori                       |\n|                             20 g | Tomato (3-cm quarters)                |\n|                            ¼ tsp | Cumin seeds (whole)               |\n|                            2 pcs | Cardamom (whole)                  |\n|                          1 piece | Cinnamon (whole)                  |\n|                          1 piece | Bay leaf                          |\n|                         4 pieces | Green chillies (slit)             |\n|                              7 g | Ginger paste                      |\n|                             15 g | Cumin powder                      |\n|  4 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating) | Turmeric powder                   |\n|                              1 g | Red chilli powder                 |\n| 18 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating) | Salt                              |\n|                             15 g | Sugar                             |\n|                            350 g | Water (hot)                       |\n|                              6 g | Coriander leaves (finely chopped) |\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- Lid for the cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE INGREDIENTS**\n1. Smear the _koi machh_ with ¾ tsp each of salt and turmeric till they are evenly coated. Set them aside.\n2. Cut a cauliflower into chunky florets, about 5 cm large. Take as many florets as there are pieces of fish (in this case, five).\n3. Peel and cut the potatoes lengthwise. Again, we need as many pieces of potatoes as there are fish.\n4. Chop the tomato into 3-cm quarters.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE _BORI_, CAULIFLOWER, AND FISH**\n1. Heat a _kadai_ till it is completely hot. Drizzle 30 g mustard oil into the pan till it starts smoking lightly, and changes colour from deep to pale yellow.\n2. Add all the _dal’er bori_ into the oil and fry them till they are golden. This should take about 15–20 seconds. The bori tend to brown quickly, so stay on the watch.\n3. Remove the fried _bori_ from the pan and set aside.\n4. Now, add the cauliflower florets, along with ¼ tsp of salt, to the pan and fry them till they develop a light-brown colour. This should take about 4 minutes in all.\n5. Remove the cauliflower from the pan and set aside.\n6. Finally, add the marinated _koi machh_ to the same oil, one at a time, and fry them for no longer than a minute on each side. This is a freshwater fish with delicate flavours. So be sure not to sear the fish too long.\n7. Remove the fish from the pan and set aside.\n8. You now have fried _bori_, fried cauliflower, and fried fish ready for use at a later stage, and can now move on to the preparation of the curry.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING THE _JHOL_**\n1. At this point, inspect the oil in your pan. If it looks too burnt, replace it with 10 g of fresh mustard oil. If it is alright, use the same oil to cook the curry in as it contains all the flavour from the fried fish.\n2. Temper the oil, set on medium heat, with the bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin seeds, and 2 slit green chillies.\n3. Add the potatoes to the pan and fry them, with the lid on, for 4 minutes.\n4. While the potatoes are frying, make a paste by combining cumin powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, salt, sugar, and 50 g water.\n5. Add this mixture into the pan and fry it, with lid on, till the water dries up.\n6. Now, add in the ginger paste and the tomatoes, and incorporate them with the spices. Introduce another 50 g water to the pan and sauté the spices again till the water dries off.\n7. The key here is to cover and cook because, alongside sautéing the spices, we also want to allow time for the potatoes to become tender.\n8. Add in the fried cauliflower florets, fold them into the spices, and cook them for a minute or so.\n9. Now, add 350 g of hot water to the pan. This will form the curry.\n10. Once it comes to a boil, add in the fried _bori_, fried fish, and two (more) of the slit green chillies.\n11. Using a spoon, gently try and submerge the fish in the curry. Be delicate as the fish is quite fragile at this stage.\n12. Cover the pan and allow the curry to simmer for about 6 minutes.\n13. Chop fresh coriander and add it to the pan. Let it simmer in the curry for another minute before turning off the heat.\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n","source":"_posts/koi-machher-jhol-phulkopi-diye.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Koi Machh’er Jhol Phulkopi diye\ndescription: Video recipe for traditional Bengali fish curry made with koi fish simmered in a light gravy along with cauliflowers, bori and potatoes\ntags:\n  - fish\n  - koi machh\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1484875328/website-thumbnail-koi-phulkopi_c0rzir.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: q6q2PZLSOSI\ndate: 2017-01-19 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Koi Machh'er Jhol Phulkopi diye\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1484875490/thumbnail-small-koi-phulkopi_kb0bll.jpg\",\"description\":\"This is a light Bengali fish curry of the climbing perch (_koi machh_) and fried cauliflower florets.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT20M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT40M\",\"recipeYield\":\"5 servings\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"30 g  Mustard oil (for frying)\",\"10 g  Mustard oil (for cooking)\",\"350 g (or 5 pieces)  Koi machh (climbing perch fish)\",\"150 g (or 5 pieces)  Cauliflower (5-cm florets)\",\"100 g (or 5 pieces)  Potatoes (cut lengthwise)\",\"10 pieces  Dal’er bori\",\"20 g  Tomato (3-cm quarters)\",\"¼ tsp  Cumin seeds (whole)\",\"2 pcs  Cardamom (whole)\",\"1 piece  Cinnamon (whole)\",\"1 piece  Bay leaf\",\"4 pieces  Green chillies (slit)\",\"7 g  Ginger paste\",\"15 g  Cumin powder\",\"4 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating)  Turmeric powder\",\"1 g  Red chilli powder\",\"18 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating)  Salt\",\"15 g  Sugar\",\"350 g  Water (hot)\",\"6 g  Coriander leaves (finely chopped)\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

Also known as the climbing perch fish because of its ability <em>climb</em> out of water and walk on land for short distances, <em>koi machh</em> is <em>always</em> bought live at fish markets. It has an extremely slippery exterior, making the use of ash rather necessary while handling the fish for cleaning. Even if the <em>koi machh</em> is scaled, degilled, and cleaned by your fish-seller, it might still be quite slimy to the touch. At home, you may need to rub the fish against an abrasive surface to get rid of the slipperiness (a perforated, steel colander-plate does this job quite well).</p>\n<p>Coming to this recipe, its main ingredients, <em>koi machh</em> and <em>phulkopi</em> (cauliflower), are fried separately to enhance their flavours, and then added to the delicious <em>jhol</em>. The <em>jhol</em> itself is a hot, gingery, <em>garam-masala</em>-infused curry that is mildly sweet, but never too spicy. It uplifts the taste of anything it gets soaked up in—potatoes, cauliflower, <em>bori</em>, or the fish. Eaten with a generous helping of steaming hot rice, this dish, the <em>phulkopi diye koi machh’er jhol</em> is the Bengali’s favourite fish curry for the winter months.<br></p></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 40 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 5 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>30 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil (for frying)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil (for cooking)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>350 g (or 5 pieces)</td>\n<td>Koi machh (climbing perch fish)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>150 g (or 5 pieces)</td>\n<td>Cauliflower (5-cm florets)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g (or 5 pieces)</td>\n<td>Potatoes (cut lengthwise)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 pieces</td>\n<td>Dal’er bori</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 g</td>\n<td>Tomato (3-cm quarters)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Cumin seeds (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 pcs</td>\n<td>Cardamom (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 piece</td>\n<td>Cinnamon (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 piece</td>\n<td>Bay leaf</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 pieces</td>\n<td>Green chillies (slit)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7 g</td>\n<td>Ginger paste</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Cumin powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating)</td>\n<td>Turmeric powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 g</td>\n<td>Red chilli powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18 g (plus ¾ tsp for marinating)</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>350 g</td>\n<td>Water (hot)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 g</td>\n<td>Coriander leaves (finely chopped)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Mixing bowl</li>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan</li>\n<li>Lid for the cooking vessel</li>\n<li><em>Khunti</em> | long spatula</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><p><strong>STEP I—PREPPING THE INGREDIENTS</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Smear the <em>koi machh</em> with ¾ tsp each of salt and turmeric till they are evenly coated.

The outer shell, the _paratha_ itself, must be flaky yet soft. It should not be too chewy, that is to say, you should not have to tug at it with your teeth. Most importantly, the _paratha_ should be fully cooked and crisp. The filling should be evenly distributed so you get a little of everything with each bite.

Simply bite into your roll and when you reach the paper, gently grip the roll with your teeth to slide it out as you go along. No overflowing filling, no leaking sauces.

Essentially a porridge of rice and dal tempered with a handful of spices (that can vary from region to region), _khichuri_ can be as plain or as rich as you want it to be. It ranges from the mild, runny, and carefully spiced version for when you are under the weather, to the steaming and slurpy one for those wistful rainy days, to the thick, gorgeous, ghee-laden offering made to your favourite goddesses during _pujo_. \n\nToday’s recipe can double as an easy _bhog’er khichuri_, as well as a delicious, sustaining rainy-day meal. It is made with _shona moong_—little grains of golden _moong dal_ commonly found in Bengal. The rice used is _gobindobhog chaal_, a scented, short-grained variety with which _polao_ and _payesh_ are also typically made. \n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 1 hour 15 minutes\n**YIELDS** 6-8 servings\n**CALORIES** 413 kcal per serving\n***\n## Ingredients\n|   Quantity | Ingredient                 |\n|------------|----------------------------|\n|      200 g | Moong dal                  |\n|      200 g | Gobindobhog rice           |\n|      200 g | Potatoes (5 cm chunks)     |\n|      200 g | Cauliflower (5 cm florets) |\n|      100 g | Tomatoes (quartered)       |\n|       80 g | Peas (blanched)            |\n|        2 g | Cumin seeds                |\n|      3 pcs | Cardamom (whole)           |\n|       1 pc | Cinnamon (whole)           |\n|      3 pcs | Cloves (whole)             |\n|      3 pcs | Dried red chillies         |\n|      4 pcs | Bay leaves                 |\n|       40 g | Ginger paste               |\n|       40 g | Grated coconut             |\n|        5 g | Turmeric powder            |\n|        5 g | Cumin powder               |\n|       25 g | Salt                       |\n|       50 g | Sugar                      |\n|      5 pcs | Green chillies (slit)      |\n|       10 g | Ghee                       |\n|      ½ tsp | Garam masala powder        |\n|       20 g | Vegetable oil              |\n|       15 g | Mustard oil                |\n| 1.8 litres | Hot water                  |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Large _kadai_ | frying pan | boiling pot\n- Lid for the cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n- Colander or draining nets\n- Electric kettle | saucepan (to heat water)\n\n## Appliances\n- Grinder | grater (to grate coconut)\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1.

Bitter foods, in particular, are well-known antioxidants that contain immunity-boosting enzymes. In Bengal, these are generally consumed around springtime, when the weather transitions from chilly to hot and all manner of allergens/viruses are in the air. Over the years, Bengali cooks have devised clever and delicious ways to incorporate bitters in their diet—from fried _neem_ leaves to _korola bhaja_ to _shukto_.\n\n<p>Today we show you how to prepare _korola bhaja_—batter-fried rings of bitter gourd—in just 20 minutes. In this recipe, the _korola_ is twice cooked—first steamed and then fried. The batter itself is simple. It is mildly seasoned with some salt, sugar, and green chillies. _Nigella seeds_ provide a subtle fragrance, while _posto_ (poppy) adds crunch. We top it off with a drizzle of raw, pungent mustard oil for crispiness.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 20 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 4 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                      |\n|----------|---------------------------------|\n|    150 g | Bitter gourd (1-cm rings)       |\n|     50 g | Maida (all-purpose flour)       |\n|      3 g | Salt                            |\n|      8 g | Sugar                           |\n|  1 pinch | Turmeric powder                 |\n|  1 pinch | Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)     |\n|      2 g | Posto (poppy seeds)             |\n|  1 piece | Green chilli (finely chopped)   |\n|      5 g | Mustard oil                     |\n|     75 g | Water                           |\n|  ~ 250 g | Vegetable oil (for deep-frying) |\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Sauce pan | boiling pot (with lid)\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- Forks\n- _Jhhajhhri hata_ | perforated spoon\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n\n1. Divide the _korola_ (bitter gourd) into rings, 1 cm wide.\n2. Transfer to a saucepan and add hot water, just enough to submerge all the rings. With the lid on, steam the _korola_ for about 10 minutes. We don’t want to completely cook the vegetable at this stage. The rings will be deep-fried later on; the steaming will give the cooking process a head-start.\n3. Drain the bitter gourd rings immediately and set aside to cool.\n4. Meanwhile, prepare a batter by mixing the flour, salt, sugar, turmeric, nigella seeds, poppy seeds, green chilli, mustard oil, and water in the given proportions.\n5. Mix the batter till well combined.\n6. Set a kadai on the stove and heat it up. Add vegetable oil to the pan, at least 4 cm deep.\n7. On medium flame, allow the oil to heat up completely. You can check by dropping some batter into the oil, and if it floats to the top immediately, with bubbles all around it, the oil is good to go. Remove the fried batter from the oil before proceeding, though.\n8. Dunk the steamed _korola_ rings in the batter, one at a time, and coat them well.\n9. Gently lower them into the oil. You can fry about 8 to 10 rings at a time, depending on the size of your pan. But be sure not to overcrowd the pan, or they won’t turn out crispy.\n10. Once they are golden-brown, drain the fritters from the oil.\n11.

Larger pieces will not only fail to yield curry of the desired texture, but will also prevent the seasoning and spices from entering the _lau_. Throughout the cooking process, keep the heat low and the pan covered. Stir occasionally to ensure that the _lau_ doesn’t stick to the pan. In this version of the _lau’er ghonto_, besides the usual suspects (ginger, cumin powder, [_garam masala_](/recipe/bengali-garam-masala/), etc.), we have also added some roasted _moong dal_ and fried _dal’er bori_.

Divide the bottle gourd into 6–8 cm segments and remove its skin. Now, cut each segment into slices, 3 mm wide. Then bunch up about 3–4 of the slices at a time, and further cut them into matchsticks, 3 mm wide.\n2. In a small bowl, make a paste by mixing the ginger, turmeric, cumin powder, and 25 g water. Set aside.\n3. In a pan set on medium flame, add the _moong dal_.\n4. Dry-roast the _dal_, stirring continuously, till it changes colour to a pinkish-brown. This should take about 4 minutes.\n5. Once the _dal_ is roasted, remove it from the pan, and set aside for later.\n5. To the same pan set on medium heat, add 15 g mustard oil.\n6. Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, add in the _dal’er bori_.\n7. Fry the _boris_ till they turn golden. Drain from the oil and set aside for later.\n8. Temper the same oil with the dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and cumin seeds.\n9. Once the whole spices have started crackling, add the ginger-turmeric-cumin paste that we prepared earlier.\n10. Fry the spices till they release oil (about 4 minutes). You may add an additional 25 g water to the pan if the spices turn dry and start to stick to the bottom of the pan.\n11. Once the spices have fried, add in the roasted _moong dal_ and cook everything for 2 minutes.\n12. Then add all the shredded _lau_, along with the salt. Mix till the vegetable is coated with the spices.\n13. Cover the pan and let the _lau_ steam for a good 20 minutes. During this time, the salt will help draw the moisture from the gourd and soften it. Don’t forget to stir occasionally to ensure that the _lau_ doesn’t stick to the pan.\n14. Once the gourd is soft, add the sugar and slit green chillies. Cover and cook for another 8 minutes.\n15. Break the fried _bori_ into shards and add them to the pan, along with freshly chopped coriander leaves.

Divide the bottle gourd into 6–8 cm segments and remove its skin. Now, cut each segment into slices, 3 mm wide. Then bunch up about 3–4 of the slices at a time, and further cut them into matchsticks, 3 mm wide.\n2. In a small bowl, make a paste by mixing the ginger, turmeric, cumin powder, and 25 g water. Set aside.\n3. In a pan set on medium flame, add the _moong dal_.\n4. Dry-roast the _dal_, stirring continuously, till it changes colour to a pinkish-brown. This should take about 4 minutes.\n5. Once the _dal_ is roasted, remove it from the pan, and set aside for later.\n5. To the same pan set on medium heat, add 15 g mustard oil.\n6. Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, add in the _dal’er bori_.\n7. Fry the _boris_ till they turn golden. Drain from the oil and set aside for later.\n8. Temper the same oil with the dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and cumin seeds.\n9. Once the whole spices have started crackling, add the ginger-turmeric-cumin paste that we prepared earlier.\n10. Fry the spices till they release oil (about 4 minutes). You may add an additional 25 g water to the pan if the spices turn dry and start to stick to the bottom of the pan.\n11. Once the spices have fried, add in the roasted _moong dal_ and cook everything for 2 minutes.\n12. Then add all the shredded _lau_, along with the salt. Mix till the vegetable is coated with the spices.\n13. Cover the pan and let the _lau_ steam for a good 20 minutes. During this time, the salt will help draw the moisture from the gourd and soften it. Don’t forget to stir occasionally to ensure that the _lau_ doesn’t stick to the pan.\n14. Once the gourd is soft, add the sugar and slit green chillies. Cover and cook for another 8 minutes.\n15. Break the fried _bori_ into shards and add them to the pan, along with freshly chopped coriander leaves. Cook everything for about 4 minutes before garnishing with _ghee_.\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | roti\n","slug":"lau-ghonto-with-moong-dal-bori","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-30T02:28:49.965Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjqrmmt7f003pyovhvhoo2ehr","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A spicy, dry bottle-gourd curry</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">This bottle-gourd preparation is mellow, spicy, and nutty, all at the same time.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">L</span><em>au’er <a href=\"/tags/ghonto/\">ghonto</a></em> is a dry, hot-and-spicy curry that is prepared by steaming the bottle gourd in its own juices.

Shape each portion of the dough into a round ball. Resting the dough for 5 minutes each before shaping and rolling will make the job easier.\n7. Roll each ball into a disc of about 10 cm in diameter. Beginners may roll out the _luchis_ between two sheets of well-oiled baking paper. This will help apply pressure evenly.\n8. Lower the discs into hot oil set over medium heat and fry the _luchis_ one at a time, gently patting their tops with the flat end of your frying spoon to make them puff.\n9.

Soak the poppy seeds in hot water for at least two hours. After that, grind them to a fine paste. When you rub some of the paste between your fingers, it should feel smooth, that is, the individual poppy seeds should not be discernable. The finer you grind the poppy seeds, the better the flavour.\n2. Peel the _lau_ and cut it into 3-mm-thick matchsticks.\n3. Set a pan on medium heat and add in the _lau_ along with half of the salt (about 10 g) and 30 g of water. Cover and allow the _lau_ to steam for 8 minutes. This will give the vegetable a head start while cooking.\n4. Once the _lau_ is soft remove it from the pan and reserve in a bowl along with the juices.\n5. Set the _kadai_ back on the heat. Wipe it dry so that when you add oil to it, it doesn’t splatter.\n6. Heat 20 g vegetable oil. Once hot, drop the _dal’er bori_ and fry them till they are golden. This should take about 20 seconds. Drain them from the oil and set aside.\n7. Before proceeding any further, mix 20 g water in the ginger paste and keep it ready.\n8. Temper the same oil with bay leaves and mustard seeds.\n9. Wait for the seeds to crackle before adding the ginger paste. Fry it for about 4 minutes.\n10. Next, add the steamed _lau_ along with the reserved juices. Mix everything well.\n11. At this stage, also add the remaining salt (12 g) and all of the sugar. Also stir in the poppy paste.\n11. Let everything bubble for about 6 minutes on medium heat. If you find that juices are running dry, drop the heat or cover the pan.\n12. Break the fried _bori_ into shards and add it to the shukto.\n13. Mix the flour into the milk and add that to the shukto too. The flour will help thicken the juices and allow them to coat the _lau_.\n14. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, after which add the ghee, cover, and rest before serving.\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | roti\n","slug":"lau-shukto","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-30T03:05:19.728Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjqrmmt7n003zyovhy4y84h2l","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">An easy <em>shukto</em> of bottle-gourd</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">This creamy, mellow, bottle-gourd appetiser is one of the quickest <em>shukto</em> recipes, that can be cooked in under an hour with very little preparation.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">I</span>n Bengali cooking, <em>shukto</em> refers to a wide array of mild, sometimes bitter, milky curries.

Peel the pumpkin and cut it into 4-cm-large cubes.\n2. Transfer the cubes to a saucepan. Add 200 g water and 10 g salt. Cover and boil the pumpkin till it is 90 per cent tender. This should take roughly about 10 minutes. Do not drain the water, as we’ll need it later to form the curry.\n3. While the pumpkin is boiling, crush ¼ tsp _kaalo jeere_ and 1 green chilli with a pinch of salt using a _sheel-nora_ or mortar and pestle. _Kaalo jeere_ and green chillies are the main flavours of this dish, so make sure they are freshly crushed.\n4. Also make some coconut paste using a grinder or _sheel-nora_\n5. Now, heat 15 g mustard oil in a pan. Once it starts to smoke lightly and changes colour to a pale yellow, temper it with 2 dried red chillies, 1 bay leaf, 1 green chilli, and ⅛ tsp _kalo jeere_.\n6. Next, add the boiled pumpkin along with the water.\n7. Then add the pasted coconut and stir it in.\n8. Bubble for a minute before adding the crushed _kaalo jeere_ and green chillies mixture. Also add the sugar at this point.\n9. Mix the _maida_ into the milk, and add the solution to the pan. Let everything boil for about 4 to 5 minutes, so that the _maida_ can help thicken the gravy slightly, before turning off the heat.\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n","slug":"kumrar-jhal","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-30T02:28:19.407Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjqrmmt7q0042yovhzrqr9gwa","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A light pumpkin curry with coconut, green chillies and nigella seeds</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">This light yet vibrant curry is probably unlike anything you’ve ever tasted.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">A</span> <a href=\"/tags/jhal\"><em>jhal</em></a> is a type of Bengali curry characterised by the sharpness of its flavours, unlike its close cousin, the <em>jhol</em>, which is usually more mellow.

Take 1 kg milk in a heavy-bottom saucepan and set it to boil.\n2. Once bubbling, stir in 45 g sugar.\n3. Keep boiling the milk, while stirring it continuously, for about 90 minutes.\n4. During this entire time, the pot should be on medium to low heat.\n5. At regular intervals of 3–4 minutes, scrape the solids from the bottom and sides of the pot, and incorporate them into the boiling milk. This step, as well as the previous one, is crucial. We don’t want our _kheer_ to burn at any point.\n6. Once the milk has reduced and thickened (when you lift some of it on your spoon and drop it, it should falls in clumps), make a paste of ¾ tsp flour and 1 tbsp milk.\n7. Add this paste to the pot. Stir and cook for another 5 minutes.\n8. Divide the _kheer_ into 10 portions of 20 g each.\n9. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least two hours.\n\n**STEP II—THE PASTRY DOUGH**\n1. In a mixing bowl, take 200 g flour, 40 g _ghee_, and 4 g salt. Mix these ingredients well till they take on a bread-crumb texture. The idea is to distribute the fat among the flour particles, in order to make the pastry crisp and flaky.\n2. Now, add in 80 g water.\n3. Mix until the dough comes together. This is a tight dough, so don’t add more water even if it seems a bit dry at first.\n4. Cover the dough and rest it for at least 20 minutes.\n\n**STEP III—SHAPING**\n1. Once the _kheer_ has chilled in the fridge for at least 2 hours, and the pastry dough is rested for at least 20 minutes, proceed to shaping each of them.\n2. Shape each 20 g portion of _kheer_ into 3 cm by 4 cm tablets. Put them back in the fridge to chill, till needed.\n3. Divide the dough in 10 portions of 30 g each.\n4. Shape each portion into a flat disc. Cover and rest, till needed.\n5. This proportion—20 g _kheer_ and 30 g dough—will give you the best filling to pastry ratio.\n\n**STEP IV—CONSTRUCTION**\n1. Roll each portion of the dough into a 14 cm disc, about 1 mm thick.\n2. Place a _kheer_ tablet at the centre of the disc.\n3. With your fingertips, apply water to the edges of the rolled pastry. This will act as a glue.\n4. Fold the opposite ends over one another, overlapping them. Press gently to seal.\n5. Turn the pastry over and apply water to the protruding wings. Fold them over each other, sealing them as you go.\n6. Use a clove to seal the topmost layer of the envelope in place.\n7. Follow these steps for all the pastries.\n\n**STEP V—THE SUGAR SYRUP**\n1. In a saucepan, add 400 g sugar and 200 g water.\n2. Cover with a lid, and set it on medium heat for about 10 minutes, or till the sugar syrup starts bubbling.\n3. For this recipe, we do not want a thick syrup. It should be the consistency of, say, packaged fruit juice.\n\n **STEP VI—THE SUGAR SYRUP**\n1. Heat oil in a frying pan to 150°C. The oil should be 5-cm deep.\n2. **_Lobongo lotika_ is not fried in hot oil like other deep-fried snacks or crisps. Since this pastry has a lot of layers of flour, we must fry it at low temperatures to ensure that all the layers cook through.

Because of the slow frying, each batch of _lobongo lotika_ will take about 30 minutes to cook completely.  \n4. During this period, **turn them every five minutes** to ensure that the dough is getting cooked, and hardening, from both sides evenly. Otherwise, the _kheer_ may start to ooze out of the softer end.\n5. In case the filling leaks into the oil, you may remove the damaged pastry from the oil and put it inside an oven at 175°C for about 20 minutes.\n6. Once the pastries are golden-brown in colour, drain them from the oil and dunk them in the sugar syrup. Coat well, shake off the excess syrup, and place them on a plate to cool.  \n\n## Served with\n- Tea\n","source":"_posts/lobongo-lotika.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Lobongo Lotika\ntags:\n  - vegetarian\n  - snack\n  - sweets\ndescription: >-\n  Lobongo lotika is a flaky parcel, filled with kheer (sweetened, reduced milk), sealed with a clove, deep fried, and coated with sugar syrup.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1491526895/lobongo-lotika-website-thumbnail-_casq91.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: 7FiVDkUjkF4\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Lobongo Lotika\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1491526895/lobongo-lotika-website-thumbnail-_casq91.jpg\",\"description\":\"Lobongo lotika is a flaky parcel, filled with kheer (sweetened, reduced milk), sealed with a clove, deep fried, and coated with sugar syrup.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT30M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT180M\",\"recipeYield\":\"10 pieces\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"Whole milk 1 kg\",\"Sugar 445 g\",\"Water 280 g\",\"Maida (flour) 200 g\",\"Ghee 40 g\",\"Salt 4 g\",\"Vegetable oil (for deep frying) ~ 400 g\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

This is the main rice dish of choice for any special occasion. Among the side dishes served with basanti pulao, kosha mangsho is the most popular. While there are many other kinds of polao made with different types of fruits, nuts, meat or fish, this one has become the most popular, featuring prominently on the menus of Bengali specialty restaurants such as Bhojohori Manna, Kewpie’s, etc.</p>\n<p>Use aged, non-parboiled (<em>aatop</em>) gobindobhog rice for this dish. New rice breaks very easily and will lead to a mash instead of perfectly cooked individual grains. We fry the rice before boiling it to enhance its flavours and break down the starch (which prevents rice from turning sticky). Also be careful of the amount of water you add. For 500 g rice, we’re using 1050 g water. However, as quality of rice varies widely, it is best that you reserve some of the water (5–10%) and add only if necessary. </p>\n<p>This polao tastes best the next day, so plan accordingly. Resting allows all the flavours to mingle nicely. It also ensures that all the moisture is absorbed by rice grains, leading to fluffier polao. </p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 1 hour 30 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 6 servings<br><strong>CALORIES</strong> 520 kcal per serving</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>500 g</td>\n<td>Aged gobindobhog rice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>105 g</td>\n<td>Bengali-style ghee</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 g</td>\n<td>Ginger (finely chopped)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n<td>Turmeric</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8 pcs</td>\n<td>Cardamom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 pcs</td>\n<td>Cinnamon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8 pcs</td>\n<td>Cloves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 pcs</td>\n<td>Bay leaves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>70 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>35 g</td>\n<td>Cashew nuts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>35 g</td>\n<td>Raisins</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 pcs</td>\n<td>Green chillies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1050 g</td>\n<td>Hot water</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Mixing bowl</li>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan</li>\n<li><em>Khunti</em> | long spatula</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n<li>Electric kettle (optional)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Wash and rinse rice, and leave it to air-dry over a strainer. </li>\n<li>Once dry, transfer it to a mixing bowl.

It makes use of vegetable parts that would otherwise have been thrown away—the _lau’er khosha_ or peels of bottle gourd. Bengal has been unfortunate to witness a number of travesties throughout its history—two very major famines, the Partition, and a number of instances of large-scale migration. Even though the region has been blessed with agricultural abundance, these events, especially the famines, forced cooks to think of alternative means of sustenance. They turned to scraps, not-so-fresh vegetable rejects at the _bazaar_, and tough, fibrous parts of plants that no one thought to eat previously. The shrewd skills of the cooks, the women of the household, were called upon to make these throwaway items delectable. Several such recipes have survived to the modern day. Times may not be so tough, but the fact that we still actively seek out and prepare such dishes is testament to the sheer genius of our foremothers.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 20 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                        |\n|----------|-----------------------------------|\n|    175 g | Peels of lau (bottle gourd)       |\n|     15 g | Mustard oil (for frying)          |\n|  1 piece | Dried red chilli                  |\n|  1 piece | Bay leaf                          |\n|    ¼ tsp | Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)       |\n| 4 pieces | Dal’er bori                       |\n|      6 g | Grated coconut                    |\n|  1 piece | Green chilli (slit)               |\n|      3 g | Salt                              |\n|    ¼ tsp | Turmeric powder                   |\n|      6 g | Sugar                             |\n|      4 g | Coriander leaves (finely chopped) |\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Grater | grinder\n\n## Method\n1.

Peel potatoes and smear on them yellow food colour. Keep the potatoes whole (each piece should be about 80 g) and go easy on the amount of food colour.","2. Heat vegetable oil, 3 cm deep, in a pan. Fry the potatoes until they are lightly coloured on all sides (about 4 minutes).","3. Drain them from the oil and set aside.","4. In the same oil, add sliced onions, a small handful at a time, to make birista. Watch the full video on how to make birista.","5. Weigh two separate portions of birista—20 g and 15 g—and keep ready.","6. In a pan set over medium heat, add all the spices in the given proportions for ‘biryani masala’ (see above). Gently toast them, stirring continuously.","7. Transfer the toasted spices to a spice grinder and blitz them to a fine powder.","8. Weigh two separate portions of biryani masala—8 g and 5 g— and keep ready.","9. Peel ginger and garlic, roughly chop them, and crush them into a fine paste.","10. In a large mixing bowl or pressure cooker, mix together yoghurt, ginger and garlic paste, birista, kewra water, biryani masala, red chilli powder, salt, and ground pepper, in the proportions given above for ‘marinating mutton’.","11. Add the mutton pieces and coat them well with the marinade, making sure to to massage it into the crevices too.","12. Cover and set aside for 1 hour.","13. Meanwhile, wash the rice and soak it in water for 30 minutes. At the end of this time, drain the water and strain the rice over a net or colander. Set aside. Soaking leads to longer and fluffier rice grains.","14. After the mutton has had 1 hour to marinate, transfer it to a pressure cooker.","15. Lay the fried potatoes at the bottom of the pressure cooker, followed by the mutton on top.","16. Add 150 g water and pressure cook it on medium-low heat for 30 minutes. Allow the steam to release naturally for another 15 minutes before opening the lid of the pressure cooker.","17. Separating mutton, potatoes, and yakhni: Extract the potatoes and mutton pieces in separate dishes and set them aside. Now strain the liquid remaining in the pressure cooker. This is called ‘yakhni’ (a broth resulting from mutton and spices cooked together). We need just 200 g of it, so weigh it out and keep ready.","18. Place the spices mentioned in the ‘rice’ section above in the given proportions on a small square of cheesecloth. Tie them with a piece of twine to form a bag.","19. In a large pot, take 3 kg water. Add 45 g salt to it.","20. Add the bag of spices to the water and allow it to come to a boil (should take about 20 minutes).","21. Meanwhile, prepare for assembly by weighing out all that you will need (see ‘assembly’ section above) and keeping ready.","22. This is the order in which you will need everything: Bay leaves, Cooked mutton pieces, Cooked potatoes, Alubukhara, Birista, Rose petals (if using), Biryani masala, Grated khoya kheer, Yakhni, Lime juice, Saffron and yellow food colour mixed in 20 g warm milk, Rose water, kewra water, and meetha attar mixed in 180 g warm milk, Ghee and butter, melted together in the microwave.","23. Set the biryani’r hnari or pan you are using for dum on low heat. Grease it with ghee.","24. Lay bay leaves in a single layer to cover the bottom of the pan. These will impart an aroma and provide buffer against burning.","25. Place the mutton pieces in a single layer, and the potatoes on top of the mutton. Don’t place potatoes too close to the edge or you might accidentally cut into them while serving.","26. Strew alubukhara, birista, and rose petals evenly.","27. Take half the stipulated amount of biryani masala and khoya kheer, and spread evenly. We will use the remaining half in the next layer.","28. Now add the yakhni and lime juice.","29. By this time the water for your rice should have come to a boil and its colour changed. Extract the bag of spices and discard it. Add the rice and let it cook until 80% done, that is, until when the centre is no longer hard, but the grain is still firm. Our rice took about 5 minutes to reach this stage, but read your packet instructions.","30. Strain rice, a ladle at a time, and spread it directly in the pan. Repeat this until half the rice is added to the pan.","31. On top of this first layer of rice, spread the remaining biryani masala and khoya kheer. Also spread the saffron+colour mixture evenly.","32. Now strain the rest of the rice and add it to the pan. Flatten it gently.","33. On top of the second layer of rice, add milk mixed with the aromatics. Also add melted butter and ghee, making sure to drizzle it near the sides of the pan too.","34. Cover the pan with heavy-duty aluminium foil (if yours is thin, use double layers), sealing the sides well so that no steam escapes. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. If you don’t want to use foil, you can also seal the lid with a wet flour dough.","35. Set the pan on dum on medium-low heat for 30 minutes. Turn of the heat and allow it to rest another 15 minutes before serving."]},"_content":"\n\n\n\n<p class=\"post-byline\">A distinctive biryani full of flavour but low on spiciness and heat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Fragrant rice and soft mutton get together in this classic Calcutta biryani dish. Contains potatoes!</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n[_In this series, we tip our hats to some of our favourite dishes available in the restaurants, cafés, and cabins of Calcutta. Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city. Make these at home, or hunt them down from the source—irrespective of how you get your hands on these items, we hope you enjoy them._]\n\n<span class=\"dropcap\">C</span>alcuttans are truly passionate about their mutton biryani. Kolkata has its distinct style of biryani which is on a par with the best biryanis in India—including Lucknow-style biryani and the Hyderabadi biryani. Kolkata biryani, in spite of the usage of a staggering number of spices, is not spicy. It is subtle and fragrant without being dry. A good Kolkata biryani should be moist and can be eaten on its own—no raita or salan required. This style of biryani is descended from the Lucknow style biryani that came to Calcutta with the exiled Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah (remember Satyajit Ray's \"Satranj Ke Khilari\"?). \n\nWhat started with just a handful of restaurants such as Royal India Hotel, Shiraz, and Aminia has become the most widely available and eaten street food in Calcutta. Many new restaurants have sprung up and the competition for excellent biryani in Calcutta is only getting tougher. Our recipe of the Kolkata mutton biryani isn't perfect, but it is very, very close. With some practice, planning and patience this recipe will help you make a very good Calcutta-style biryani at home.\n\n[DOWNLOAD Biryani Timeline

pan\n- _Jhhajhhri_ | perforated frying spoon\n- Mortar and pestle\n- Strainer | colander\n- Large pot with lid\n- Cheesecloth and twine\n- Grater\n- _Biryani’r hnari_ | large pan with tight-fitting lid (for dum)\n- Heavy-duty aluminium foil | wet flour dough \n\n## Appliances\n- Spice grinder\n- Pressure cooker\n- Stove\n- Weighing scale\n\n\n\n## Method\n\n**STEP I—FRYING POTATOES**\n1. Peel potatoes and smear on them yellow food colour. Keep the potatoes whole (each piece should be about 80 g) and go easy on the amount of food colour.\n2. Heat vegetable oil, 3 cm deep, in a pan. Fry the potatoes until they are lightly coloured on all sides (about 4 minutes).\n3. Drain them from the oil and set aside. \n\n**STEP II—MAKING BIRISTA**\n1. In the same oil, add sliced onions, a small handful at a time, to make birista. Watch the full video on how to make birista.\n2. Weigh two separate portions of birista—20 g and 15 g—and keep ready.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING BIRYANI MASALA**\n1. In a pan set over medium heat, add all the spices in the given proportions for ‘biryani masala’ (see above). Gently toast them, stirring continuously.\n2. Transfer the toasted spices to a spice grinder and blitz them to a fine powder.\n3. Weigh two separate portions of biryani masala—8 g and 5 g— and keep ready.\n\n**STEP IV—MARINATING MUTTON**\n1. Peel ginger and garlic, roughly chop them, and crush them into a fine paste.\n2. In a large mixing bowl or pressure cooker, mix together yoghurt, ginger and garlic paste, birista, kewra water, biryani masala, red chilli powder, salt, and ground pepper, in the proportions given above for ‘marinating mutton’. \n3. Add the mutton pieces and coat them well with the marinade, making sure to to massage it into the crevices too.\n4. Cover and set aside for 1 hour.\n\n**STEP V—SOAKING RICE**\n1. Meanwhile, wash the rice and soak it in water for 30 minutes. At the end of this time, drain the water and strain the rice over a net or colander. Set aside. Soaking leads to longer and fluffier rice grains. \n\n**STEP IV—COOKING MUTTON**\n1. After the mutton has had 1 hour to marinate, transfer it to a pressure cooker. \n2. Lay the fried potatoes at the bottom of the pressure cooker, followed by the mutton on top (we changed this step from the video because this yields juicier potatoes).\n3. Add 150 g water and pressure cook it on medium-low heat for 30 minutes. Allow the steam to release naturally for another 15 minutes before opening the lid of the pressure cooker.\n4. *Separating mutton, potatoes, and _yakhni_:* Extract the potatoes and mutton pieces in separate dishes and set them aside. Now strain the liquid remaining in the pressure cooker. This is called ‘yakhni’ (a broth resulting from mutton and spices cooked together). We need just 200 g of it, so weigh it out and keep ready.\n\n**STEP VII—BOILING WATER FOR RICE**\n1.  Place the spices mentioned in the ‘rice’ section above in the given proportions on a small square of cheesecloth. Tie them with a piece of twine to form a bag.\n2. In a large pot, take 3 kg water. Add 30 g salt to it.\n3. Add the bag of spices to the water and allow it to come to a boil (should take about 20 minutes). \n\n**STEP VIII—PREPARING FOR ASSEMBLY**\n1. Meanwhile, prepare for assembly by weighing out all that you will need (see ‘assembly’ section above) and keeping ready.\n2. This is the order in which you will need everything.\n- Bay leaves\n- Cooked mutton pieces\n- Cooked potatoes\n- Alubukhara\n- Birista\n- Rose petals (if using)\n- Biryani masala\n- Grated khoya kheer\n- Yakhni\n- Lime juice\n- Saffron and yellow food colour mixed in 20 g warm milk\n- Rose water, kewra water, and meetha attar mixed in 180 g warm milk\n- Ghee and butter, melted together in the microwave\n\n**STEP IX—COOKING RICE, ASSEMBLY, AND DUM**\n1. Set the _biryani’r hnari_ or pan you are using for dum on low heat. Grease it with ghee.\n2. Lay bay leaves in a single layer to cover the bottom of the pan. These will impart an aroma and provide buffer against burning.\n3. Place the mutton pieces in a single layer, and the potatoes on top of the mutton. Don’t place potatoes too close to the edge or you might accidentally cut into them while serving. \n3. Strew alubukhara, birista, and rose petals evenly.\n4. Take half the stipulated amount of biryani masala and khoya kheer, and spread evenly. We will use the remaining half in the next layer. \n5. Now add the yakhni and lime juice.\n6. By this time the water for your rice should have come to a boil and its colour changed. Extract the bag of spices and discard it. Add the rice and let it cook until 80% done, that is, until when the centre is no longer hard, but the grain is still firm. Our rice took about 5 minutes to reach this stage, but read your packet instructions.\n7. Strain rice, a ladle at a time, and spread it directly in the pan. Repeat this until half the rice is added to the pan.\n8. On top of this first layer of rice, spread the remaining biryani masala and khoya kheer. Also spread the saffron+colour mixture evenly. \n9. Now strain the rest of the rice and add it to the pan. Flatten it gently.\n10. On top of the second layer of rice, add milk mixed with the aromatics. Also add melted butter and ghee, making sure to drizzle it near the sides of the pan too. \n11. Cover the pan with heavy-duty aluminium foil (if yours is thin, use double layers), sealing the sides well so that no steam escapes. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. If you don’t want to use foil, you can also seal the lid with a wet flour dough.\n12. Set the pan on dum on medium-low heat for 30 minutes. Turn of the heat and allow it to rest another 15 minutes before serving.\n\n\n## Served with\nServed with\n- [Chaap](/recipe/beef-chaap/)\n- Salad\n","source":"_posts/kolkata-mutton-biryani.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Kolkata Mutton Biryani\ntags:\n  - mosur dal\n  - dal\n  - vegetarian\n  - vegan\n  - gluten free\ndescription: >-\n  Fragrant rice and soft mutton get together in this classic Calcutta biryani\n  dish.

Contains potatoes!</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n[_In this series, we tip our hats to some of our favourite dishes available in the restaurants, cafés, and cabins of Calcutta. Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city. Make these at home, or hunt them down from the source—irrespective of how you get your hands on these items, we hope you enjoy them._]\n\n<span class=\"dropcap\">C</span>alcuttans are truly passionate about their mutton biryani. Kolkata has its distinct style of biryani which is on a par with the best biryanis in India—including Lucknow-style biryani and the Hyderabadi biryani. Kolkata biryani, in spite of the usage of a staggering number of spices, is not spicy. It is subtle and fragrant without being dry. A good Kolkata biryani should be moist and can be eaten on its own—no raita or salan required. This style of biryani is descended from the Lucknow style biryani that came to Calcutta with the exiled Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah (remember Satyajit Ray's \"Satranj Ke Khilari\"?). \n\nWhat started with just a handful of restaurants such as Royal India Hotel, Shiraz, and Aminia has become the most widely available and eaten street food in Calcutta. Many new restaurants have sprung up and the competition for excellent biryani in Calcutta is only getting tougher. Our recipe of the Kolkata mutton biryani isn't perfect, but it is very, very close. With some practice, planning and patience this recipe will help you make a very good Calcutta-style biryani at home.\n\n[DOWNLOAD Biryani Timeline

pan\n- _Jhhajhhri_ | perforated frying spoon\n- Mortar and pestle\n- Strainer | colander\n- Large pot with lid\n- Cheesecloth and twine\n- Grater\n- _Biryani’r hnari_ | large pan with tight-fitting lid (for dum)\n- Heavy-duty aluminium foil | wet flour dough \n\n## Appliances\n- Spice grinder\n- Pressure cooker\n- Stove\n- Weighing scale\n\n\n\n## Method\n\n**STEP I—FRYING POTATOES**\n1. Peel potatoes and smear on them yellow food colour. Keep the potatoes whole (each piece should be about 80 g) and go easy on the amount of food colour.\n2. Heat vegetable oil, 3 cm deep, in a pan. Fry the potatoes until they are lightly coloured on all sides (about 4 minutes).\n3. Drain them from the oil and set aside. \n\n**STEP II—MAKING BIRISTA**\n1. In the same oil, add sliced onions, a small handful at a time, to make birista. Watch the full video on how to make birista.\n2. Weigh two separate portions of birista—20 g and 15 g—and keep ready.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING BIRYANI MASALA**\n1. In a pan set over medium heat, add all the spices in the given proportions for ‘biryani masala’ (see above). Gently toast them, stirring continuously.\n2. Transfer the toasted spices to a spice grinder and blitz them to a fine powder.\n3. Weigh two separate portions of biryani masala—8 g and 5 g— and keep ready.\n\n**STEP IV—MARINATING MUTTON**\n1. Peel ginger and garlic, roughly chop them, and crush them into a fine paste.\n2. In a large mixing bowl or pressure cooker, mix together yoghurt, ginger and garlic paste, birista, kewra water, biryani masala, red chilli powder, salt, and ground pepper, in the proportions given above for ‘marinating mutton’. \n3. Add the mutton pieces and coat them well with the marinade, making sure to to massage it into the crevices too.\n4. Cover and set aside for 1 hour.\n\n**STEP V—SOAKING RICE**\n1. Meanwhile, wash the rice and soak it in water for 30 minutes. At the end of this time, drain the water and strain the rice over a net or colander. Set aside. Soaking leads to longer and fluffier rice grains. \n\n**STEP IV—COOKING MUTTON**\n1. After the mutton has had 1 hour to marinate, transfer it to a pressure cooker. \n2. Lay the fried potatoes at the bottom of the pressure cooker, followed by the mutton on top (we changed this step from the video because this yields juicier potatoes).\n3. Add 150 g water and pressure cook it on medium-low heat for 30 minutes. Allow the steam to release naturally for another 15 minutes before opening the lid of the pressure cooker.\n4. *Separating mutton, potatoes, and _yakhni_:* Extract the potatoes and mutton pieces in separate dishes and set them aside. Now strain the liquid remaining in the pressure cooker. This is called ‘yakhni’ (a broth resulting from mutton and spices cooked together). We need just 200 g of it, so weigh it out and keep ready.\n\n**STEP VII—BOILING WATER FOR RICE**\n1.  Place the spices mentioned in the ‘rice’ section above in the given proportions on a small square of cheesecloth. Tie them with a piece of twine to form a bag.\n2. In a large pot, take 3 kg water. Add 30 g salt to it.\n3. Add the bag of spices to the water and allow it to come to a boil (should take about 20 minutes). \n\n**STEP VIII—PREPARING FOR ASSEMBLY**\n1. Meanwhile, prepare for assembly by weighing out all that you will need (see ‘assembly’ section above) and keeping ready.\n2. This is the order in which you will need everything.\n- Bay leaves\n- Cooked mutton pieces\n- Cooked potatoes\n- Alubukhara\n- Birista\n- Rose petals (if using)\n- Biryani masala\n- Grated khoya kheer\n- Yakhni\n- Lime juice\n- Saffron and yellow food colour mixed in 20 g warm milk\n- Rose water, kewra water, and meetha attar mixed in 180 g warm milk\n- Ghee and butter, melted together in the microwave\n\n**STEP IX—COOKING RICE, ASSEMBLY, AND DUM**\n1. Set the _biryani’r hnari_ or pan you are using for dum on low heat. Grease it with ghee.\n2. Lay bay leaves in a single layer to cover the bottom of the pan. These will impart an aroma and provide buffer against burning.\n3. Place the mutton pieces in a single layer, and the potatoes on top of the mutton. Don’t place potatoes too close to the edge or you might accidentally cut into them while serving. \n3. Strew alubukhara, birista, and rose petals evenly.\n4. Take half the stipulated amount of biryani masala and khoya kheer, and spread evenly. We will use the remaining half in the next layer. \n5. Now add the yakhni and lime juice.\n6. By this time the water for your rice should have come to a boil and its colour changed. Extract the bag of spices and discard it. Add the rice and let it cook until 80% done, that is, until when the centre is no longer hard, but the grain is still firm. Our rice took about 5 minutes to reach this stage, but read your packet instructions.\n7. Strain rice, a ladle at a time, and spread it directly in the pan. Repeat this until half the rice is added to the pan.\n8. On top of this first layer of rice, spread the remaining biryani masala and khoya kheer. Also spread the saffron+colour mixture evenly. \n9. Now strain the rest of the rice and add it to the pan. Flatten it gently.\n10. On top of the second layer of rice, add milk mixed with the aromatics. Also add melted butter and ghee, making sure to drizzle it near the sides of the pan too. \n11. Cover the pan with heavy-duty aluminium foil (if yours is thin, use double layers), sealing the sides well so that no steam escapes. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. If you don’t want to use foil, you can also seal the lid with a wet flour dough.\n12. Set the pan on dum on medium-low heat for 30 minutes. Turn of the heat and allow it to rest another 15 minutes before serving.\n\n\n## Served with\nServed with\n- [Chaap](/recipe/beef-chaap/)\n- Salad\n","slug":"kolkata-mutton-biryani","published":1,"updated":"2018-07-09T04:14:13.730Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjqrmmt84004myovho001ummu","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A distinctive biryani full of flavour but low on spiciness and heat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Fragrant rice and soft mutton get together in this classic Calcutta biryani dish.

Kolkata has its distinct style of biryani which is on a par with the best biryanis in India—including Lucknow-style biryani and the Hyderabadi biryani. Kolkata biryani, in spite of the usage of a staggering number of spices, is not spicy. It is subtle and fragrant without being dry. A good Kolkata biryani should be moist and can be eaten on its own—no raita or salan required. This style of biryani is descended from the Lucknow style biryani that came to Calcutta with the exiled Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah (remember Satyajit Ray’s “Satranj Ke Khilari”?). </p>\n<p>What started with just a handful of restaurants such as Royal India Hotel, Shiraz, and Aminia has become the most widely available and eaten street food in Calcutta. Many new restaurants have sprung up and the competition for excellent biryani in Calcutta is only getting tougher. Our recipe of the Kolkata mutton biryani isn’t perfect, but it is very, very close. With some practice, planning and patience this recipe will help you make a very good Calcutta-style biryani at home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oB_S9Aa_5V_AOBATlf2vTc3EW_4sFW4O/view?usp=sharing\">DOWNLOAD Biryani Timeline Chart</a> </p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 4 hours<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 5–6 servings<br><strong>CALORIES</strong> </p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1 kg</td>\n<td>Mutton (large pieces of ~100g each)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 whole</td>\n<td>Potatoes (the starchy kind, e.g., ‘jyoti’, ~80g each)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>500 g</td>\n<td>Basmati rice (aged, long-grained, non-parboiled)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR THE BIRISTA</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>150 g</td>\n<td>Onions (sliced)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>~150 g</td>\n<td>Vegetable oil (for deep frying)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR BIRYANI MASALA</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1.25 g (6 pcs)</td>\n<td>Green cardamom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0.75 g (1 pc)</td>\n<td>Black cardamom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1.5 g (¾ tsp)</td>\n<td>Cloves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0.5 g (3 cm stick)</td>\n<td>Cinnamon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1.2 g (½ pc)</td>\n<td>Nutmeg</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1.75 g (2 pcs)</td>\n<td>Mace</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 g</td>\n<td>Shahi jeera</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 g</td>\n<td>Kabab chini</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 g (½ tsp)</td>\n<td>Fennel seeds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 g</td>\n<td>White pepper (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1.25 g (½ tsp)</td>\n<td>Black pepper (whole)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR MARINATING MUTTON</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g</td>\n<td>Yoghurt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Ginger</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Garlic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 g</td>\n<td>Birista</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8 g</td>\n<td>Biryani masala</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Kewra water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n<td>Red chilli powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n<td>Ground pepper</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>150 g</td>\n<td>Water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR THE RICE</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1.25 g (6 pcs)</td>\n<td>Green cardamom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1.5 g (2 pcs)</td>\n<td>Black cardamom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7 g</td>\n<td>Cloves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 g (6 cm stick)</td>\n<td>Cinnamon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7 g</td>\n<td>Fennel seeds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 g</td>\n<td>Bay leaves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 kg</td>\n<td>Water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>45 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR ASSEMBLY</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 to 10 pcs</td>\n<td>Bay leaves (to line the pan with)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>40 g</td>\n<td>Alubukhara (dried plums)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 tsp</td>\n<td>Rose petals (optional)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Birista</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Biryani masala</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50 g</td>\n<td>Grated khoya kheer (‘mawa’ or solidified milk)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>200 g</td>\n<td>Yakhni</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Lime juice (from half a lime)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pinch</td>\n<td>Saffron (steeped in 20g warm milk)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pinch</td>\n<td>Yellow food colour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>180 g</td>\n<td>Milk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Kewra water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Rose water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 drops</td>\n<td>Meetha attar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30 g</td>\n<td>Ghee</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 g</td>\n<td>Butter</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan</li>\n<li><em>Jhhajhhri</em> | perforated frying spoon</li>\n<li>Mortar and pestle</li>\n<li>Strainer | colander</li>\n<li>Large pot with lid</li>\n<li>Cheesecloth and twine</li>\n<li>Grater</li>\n<li><em>Biryani’r hnari</em> | large pan with tight-fitting lid (for dum)</li>\n<li>Heavy-duty aluminium foil | wet flour dough </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Spice grinder</li>\n<li>Pressure cooker</li>\n<li>Stove</li>\n<li>Weighing scale</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><p><strong>STEP I—FRYING POTATOES</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Peel potatoes and smear on them yellow food colour.

It differs from other stuffed _porotas_ in that filling cooks inside the _porota_, and that it is layered.\n\n_Mughlai porota_ can be made at home with a little bit of organisation. Plan for the following elements individually, and in this order:</p>\n1. **The _keema_**—This is an important component of the filling. We like to use cooked mutton or beef _keema_ (minced meat sautéed with onions, ginger, garlic, green chillies, turmeric, and _garam masala_). It needs to be prepared in advance.\n2. **The dough**—This will form the pastry within which the filling is enclosed. Be sure to knead the flour and set it to rest for at least 30 minutes.\n3. **The filling**—While your dough is resting, use this time to chop the onions, green chillies, ginger, and fresh coriander. Toast some peanuts and roughly crush them. Get the bread crumbs and salt out. Beat an egg in a bowl along with all the ingredients and your filling is ready to go!\n4. **The sides**—_Mughlai porota_ is served with a cabin-style salad of cucumber, onion, and beet, _alu'r torkari_, chicken or mutton _kosha_, and some ketchup. If you want some or all of these sides, be sure to prepare them before your start making the _mughlai_.\n5. **The _Mughlai porota_**—Now that the filling has been prepared, the sides are organised, and the dough has had time to rest, we are ready to bring all these elements together. See below for the full recipe.\n\n**COOKING TIME** 60 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 1 _mughlai porota_\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n**FOR THE POROTA/PASTRY**\n\n| Quantity | Ingredient                            |\n|----------|---------------------------------------|\n|     75 g | Flour                                 |\n|      1 g | Salt                                  |\n|      1 g | Sugar                                 |\n|      5 g | Oil                                   |\n|     40 g | Warm water                                 |\n\n**FOR THE FILLING**\n\n| Quantity | Ingredient                            |\n|----------|---------------------------------------|\n|  1 piece | Egg (beaten)                          |\n|     20 g | Keema (cooked mutton or beef keema)   |\n|     10 g | Onions (finely diced)                 |\n|      2 g | Green chillies (finely chopped)       |\n|      2 g | Ginger (finely diced)                 |\n|      3 g | Coriander (finely chopped)            |\n|      5 g | Peanuts (toasted and roughly chopped) |\n|     10 g | Bread crumbs                          |\n|      2 g | Salt                                  |\n|  ~300 ml | Oil for frying                        |\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl or dish\n- Rolling pin | large rolling surface\n- Frying pan\n- Frying spoon | _jhanjhri_\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**PART I—KNEADING THE DOUGH**\n1.

All it takes is patience.</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n<span class=\"dropcap\">M</span>utton _kosha_ is an iconic Bengali delicacy. The word _kosha_ is similar in meaning to _bhuna_, which involves slowly cooking a gravy over low flame for a very long time to get a rich, dark-brown gravy and melt-in-the-mouth mutton pieces. It is worth pointing out that in Bengal, as well as in India, mutton is commonly used to refer to goat’s meat. Mutton _kosha_ (or _kosha mangsho_) can be served with _porota_ or _polao_. It tastes great even with plain rice. One of the most famous shops selling this style of mutton _kosha_ is Golbari at the Shyambazar crossing in Calcutta. While we are not certain that our version is exactly like Golbari’s, we can assure you it certainly tastes very good.\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 1.5 to 2 hours\n**YIELDS** 6 servings\n**calories** 560 kcal per serving\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|             Quantity | Ingredient                                       | \n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n|                 1 kg | Mutton                                           |\n| **FOR THE MARINADE** |                                                  |\n|                100 g | Onion                                            |\n|                  5 g | Garlic                                           |\n|                100 g | Yoghurt                                          |\n|                 15 g | Salt                                             |\n|                  5 g | Turmeric powder                                  |\n|                  3 g | Shahi garam masala powder                        |\n|    **FOR THE CURRY** |                                                  |\n|                 20 g | Mustard oil                                      |\n|                 4 cm | Cinnamon                                         |\n|               10 pcs | Green cardamom                                   |\n|                 1 pc | Black cardamom                                   |\n|               10 pcs | Cloves                                           |\n|                4 pcs | Dried red chillies                               |\n|                6 pcs | Bay leaves                                       |\n|                400 g | Onions (sliced)                                  |\n|                 40 g | Ginger paste                                     |\n|                 10 g | Garlic                                           |\n|                 20 g | Green chillies (plus 4 extra pieces for garnish) |\n|                  3 g | Coriander powder                                 |\n|                  3 g | Cumin powder                                     |\n|                  3 g | Kashmiri red chilli powder                       |\n|            150–200 g | Yoghurt (based on how tart you want your curry)  |\n|                  8 g | Salt                                             |\n|                 10 g | Sugar                                            |\n|             ~1 litre | Hot water                                        |\n|                  5 g | Ghee                                             |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Mortar and pestle\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan with lid\n-  _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Grinder\n- Electric kettle (optional)\n\n\n## Method\n1.

Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, add the dried red chillies, bay leaves, cinnamon, green cardamom, black cardamom, and cloves. \n5. Add the onions and fry them on medium flame for about 15 minutes until they are light brown in colour. Then, add the ginger paste, and garlic and green chilli paste, and fry for another 5 minutes. Keep the flame medium to low, depending on whether your onions are sticking to the pan or not, and stir often. We want to fry the spices as well as develop colour on the onions.

There’s not much to it now. On medium heat, for the next 75 to 90 minutes,  repeat the following steps:\n  --Add a splash of _hot_ water to the pan (~30 ml at a time)\n  --Stir it in\n  --Cover the pan and cook for a minute\n  --Uncover and stir everything thoroughly <br>\n*What we’re doing here is a kind of controlled browning. Stir, scrape, and incorporate any of the browned bits that may have stuck to the bottom of the pan, as that is what will allow the mutton to develop a rich colour. However, be alert so that the gravy doesn’t burn and turn bitter. Keep adding water a little at a time and cooking the meat in the gravy.*\n8.

Using a mortar and pestle, crush together 10 g garlic and 20 g green chillies to a paste. For ease while stirring later on, you may also cut all the bay leaves in 3-cm sections using a pair of scissors.</li>\n<li>Heat a large <em>kadai</em> and add mustard oil to it. Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, add the dried red chillies, bay leaves, cinnamon, green cardamom, black cardamom, and cloves. </li>\n<li>Add the onions and fry them on medium flame for about 15 minutes until they are light brown in colour. Then, add the ginger paste, and garlic and green chilli paste, and fry for another 5 minutes. Keep the flame medium to low, depending on whether your onions are sticking to the pan or not, and stir often. We want to fry the spices as well as develop colour on the onions. Next, add the dry spices (coriander, cumin, and red chilli) mixed with 100 g of water. Continue frying the onions along with the spices for about 15 more minutes. By now (it’s been 30 minutes since we started), your onions should have taken on a reddish-brown colour and the spices started releasing their oils. </li>\n<li>Add the marinated mutton to the pan. The mutton has been in the fridge, so it is cold. Raise the heat and mix everything thoroughly. Fry the mutton, stirring frequently to check that it’s not sticking to the pan, for 15 minutes on high heat. Beat 150–200 g yoghurt until it is lump-free and add it to the pan. Also add 8 g salt and 10 g sugar at this point. Mix everything and keep frying. Once the moisture (from the cold mutton and yoghurt) starts to dry out, drop the heat to medium.</li>\n<li>There’s not much to it now. On medium heat, for the next 75 to 90 minutes,  repeat the following steps:<br>–Add a splash of <em>hot</em> water to the pan (~30 ml at a time)<br>–Stir it in<br>–Cover the pan and cook for a minute<br>–Uncover and stir everything thoroughly <br><br><em>What we’re doing here is a kind of controlled browning. Stir, scrape, and incorporate any of the browned bits that may have stuck to the bottom of the pan, as that is what will allow the mutton to develop a rich colour. However, be alert so that the gravy doesn’t burn and turn bitter. Keep adding water a little at a time and cooking the meat in the gravy.</em></li>\n<li>Once you are happy with the colour, add as much water as you’d like for the gravy/curry. Also add about 4 slit green chillies for flavour. Cover and cook until the mutton is tender. You should be able to tear it apart with two fingers.</li>\n<li>Turn off the heat and top off with a little bit of ghee. Cover and let it rest for about 2 minutes before serving.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Served-with\"><a href=\"#Served-with\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Served with\"></a>Served with</h2><ul>\n<li><a href=\"/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/\">Rice</a></li>\n<li>Polao</li>\n<li><a href=\"/recipe/bengali-vegetable-fried-rice/\">Fried rice</a></li>\n<li>Porota</li>\n<li><a href=\"/recipe/luchi/\">Luchi</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"title":"How to make momo wrappers","description":"The perfect, percise how-to video for momo or dumpling wrappers at home from scratch.","thumbnailImagePosition":"top","thumbnailImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1510863001/momo-wrappers-website-thumbnail-_sccs2p.png","coverMeta":"out","coverSize":"partial","videoId":"GNA1tpQ7dr0","date":"2017-11-16T16:00:00.000Z","jsonLd":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Recipe","name":"Momo Wrapper","author":"Bong Eats","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1510863001/momo-wrappers-website-thumbnail-_sccs2p.png","description":"The perfect, percise how-to video for momo or dumpling wrappers at home from scratch.","prepTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT2H","recipeYield":"50","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"50 momo wrappers","calories":"30 calories"},"recipeIngredient":["400 g Maida (all-purpose flour)","8 g Salt","½ tsp Baking powder","200 g Warm water"],"recipeInstructions":["1.

Mocha is the banana blossom. The niramish (vegetarian) mocha'r ghonto with narkel (coconut) and chhola (Bengal gram) is loved as much as mocha chingri garnished with small freshwater prawns. In this video, we show methods of preparing both mocha’r ghonto as well as mocha with chingri. This also includes a very easy, step-by-step guide to cleaning, preparing and cutting mocha. Like any Bengali niramish recipe, this one uses no onion or garlic—the main flavours come from ginger, cumin, ghee and garam masala. Mocha provides a crunchy texture that is a canvas for all these flavours. Give this Bengali recipe of mocha a try. It is not the best looking dish, but once you taste mocha, it will change your life.\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 2 hours   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n**CALORIES** 150 kcal per serving\n***\n\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                    | \n|----------|-------------------------------|\n|    550 g | Whole mocha (banana blossom)  |\n|     25 g | Mustard oil                   |\n|    2 pcs | Dried red chilli              |\n|     2 pc | Bay leaves                    |\n|     1 pc | Cardamom                      |\n|     1 pc | Cinnamon                      |\n|     1 pc | Cloves                        |\n|    ¼ tsp | Cumin seeds                   |\n|    100 g | Potatoes (2-cm cubes)         |\n|     20 g | Grated coconut                |\n|     20 g | Ginger paste                  |\n|      2 g | Cumin powder                  |\n|    ¼ tsp | Red chilli powder             |\n|    ¾ tsp | Turmeric                      |\n|     20 g | Salt                          |\n|     18 g | Sugar                         |\n|    4 pcs | Green chillies                |\n|      8 g | Ghee                          |\n|    ¼ tsp | Garam masala                  |\n|     25 g | Soaked chhola (Bengal gram)   |\n|     30 g | Dal’er bora (recipe below)    |\n|     75 g | Prawns (shelled and deveined) |\n\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Pressure cooker\n- Strainer | colander\n- Kadai | frying pan\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n\n1.

Prepared in Bengal during the winter months using the newly harvested baby potatoes or ‘notun alu’, alu’r dom is best enjoyed with luchi, koraishuti’r kochuri, polao, fried rice, or porota. This simple recipe is for the _niramish_ (vegetarian) version, which, in Bengali cuisine means it makes no use of onion or garlic. It can, therefore, be served as bhog. \n</p>\n\nThe key to a good alu’r dom is perfectly tender and uniformly salted potatoes, because who enjoys under-seasoned spuds? In this recipe, the baby potatoes are twice boiled—first in heavily salted water (with skin on) and then again in the curry—for a total of nearly one hour. ‘Notun alu’ are notorious in that they don’t allow salt and spices to penetrate easily. They must, therefore, be cooked longer than one would normally cook potatoes.\n\nThis is not a strictly traditional version of the Bengali niramish alu’r dom, but our take on this classic and well-loved recipe. It produces juicy alu’r dom with a rich, dry gravy, ready to be mopped up with a piece of light, fluffy luchi. \n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 75 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 6 servings\n**CALORIES** 187 kcal\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                            | \n|----------|---------------------------------------|\n|    700 g | New baby potatoes (notun alu)         |\n|     50 g | Peas (blanched)                       |\n|     30 g | Mustard oil                           |\n|    2 pcs | Dried red chillies                    |\n|    2 pcs | Bay leaves                            |\n|    3 pcs | Cloves                                |\n|    2 pcs | Cardamom                              |\n|     1 pc | Cinnamon                              |\n|    ½ tsp | Cumin seeds                           |\n|    ¼ tsp | Hing (asafoetida)                     |\n|    ½ tsp | Turmeric                              |\n|    ½ tsp | Kashmiri red chilli powder            |\n|    1 tsp | Cumin powder                          |\n|  1½ tsp  | Coriander powder                      |\n|    ½ tsp | Amchur (dried mango powder)           |\n|    ¼ tsp | Beetnoon (black salt)                 |\n|     15 g | Ginger paste                          |\n|      6 g | Green chilli paste                    |\n|     50 g | Yoghurt                               |\n|     20 g | Tomato ketchup                        |\n|     20 g | Cashewnuts (ground)                   |\n|    ½ tsp | Kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) |\n|     45 g | Total salt                            |\n|     18 g | Sugar                                 |\n|    ¼ tsp | [Bengali garam masala powder](/recipe/bengali-garam-masala/)           |\n|      5 g | Ghee                                  |\n|    400 g | Hot water (for the gravy)             |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot with lid\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n-  _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Grinder\n- Mortar and pestle\n\n\n## Method\n1.

Boiling the potatoes in heavily salted water ensures that they are uniformly seasoned. Besides, it also causes the potatoes to lose water, because of osmosis, improving their texture.\n2. Once the potatoes are tender, drain the water and peel them immediately. Coat with 10 g of salt while the potatoes are still hot. This will help in further absorption of salt.\n3. Before you begin make a paste of cumin powder, coriander powder, amchur, black salt, ginger paste, and 25 g water, and keep at the ready.\n4. Heat 30 g mustard oil in a pan. Temper it with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin seeds, and hing. Allow the hing to fry for about 10 seconds before adding turmeric powder and kashmiri red chilli powder. Fry for 20 seconds. We would normally add turmeric and red chilli to the paste we made earlier, but for this dish, frying them directly in oil will lend the gravy a rich red colour. However, dry spices are prone to getting burnt in oil, so be very careful and keep the heat low.\n5. Next, stir in the spice paste.

Add it to the pan, stirring vigorously to prevent it from splitting. Cook off the raw yoghurt for a couple of minutes before stirring in the ketchup.\n6.

Prepared in Bengal during the winter months using the newly harvested baby potatoes or ‘notun alu’, alu’r dom is best enjoyed with luchi, koraishuti’r kochuri, polao, fried rice, or porota. This simple recipe is for the _niramish_ (vegetarian) version, which, in Bengali cuisine means it makes no use of onion or garlic. It can, therefore, be served as bhog. \n</p>\n\nThe key to a good alu’r dom is perfectly tender and uniformly salted potatoes, because who enjoys under-seasoned spuds? In this recipe, the baby potatoes are twice boiled—first in heavily salted water (with skin on) and then again in the curry—for a total of nearly one hour. ‘Notun alu’ are notorious in that they don’t allow salt and spices to penetrate easily. They must, therefore, be cooked longer than one would normally cook potatoes.\n\nThis is not a strictly traditional version of the Bengali niramish alu’r dom, but our take on this classic and well-loved recipe. It produces juicy alu’r dom with a rich, dry gravy, ready to be mopped up with a piece of light, fluffy luchi. \n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 75 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 6 servings\n**CALORIES** 187 kcal\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                            | \n|----------|---------------------------------------|\n|    700 g | New baby potatoes (notun alu)         |\n|     50 g | Peas (blanched)                       |\n|     30 g | Mustard oil                           |\n|    2 pcs | Dried red chillies                    |\n|    2 pcs | Bay leaves                            |\n|    3 pcs | Cloves                                |\n|    2 pcs | Cardamom                              |\n|     1 pc | Cinnamon                              |\n|    ½ tsp | Cumin seeds                           |\n|    ¼ tsp | Hing (asafoetida)                     |\n|    ½ tsp | Turmeric                              |\n|    ½ tsp | Kashmiri red chilli powder            |\n|    1 tsp | Cumin powder                          |\n|  1½ tsp  | Coriander powder                      |\n|    ½ tsp | Amchur (dried mango powder)           |\n|    ¼ tsp | Beetnoon (black salt)                 |\n|     15 g | Ginger paste                          |\n|      6 g | Green chilli paste                    |\n|     50 g | Yoghurt                               |\n|     20 g | Tomato ketchup                        |\n|     20 g | Cashewnuts (ground)                   |\n|    ½ tsp | Kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) |\n|     45 g | Total salt                            |\n|     18 g | Sugar                                 |\n|    ¼ tsp | [Bengali garam masala powder](/recipe/bengali-garam-masala/)           |\n|      5 g | Ghee                                  |\n|    400 g | Hot water (for the gravy)             |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot with lid\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n-  _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Grinder\n- Mortar and pestle\n\n\n## Method\n1.

Divide the paneer into 3-cm cubes and smear it with ¼ tsp each of salt and turmeric. Heat a flat frying pan on medium heat. Once the pan is completely hot, add a millimetre of oil. Wait until the oil heats up fully and then place the paneer cubes in it in a single layer. Ensuring that the pan and oil are both hot will prevent the paneer from sticking to the pan. After about 45 seconds, flip the cubes and fry their opposite surfaces until they are golden. Fry just two of the surfaces, as frying all round will make the paneer rubbery and won’t allow absorption of curry later on. Remove from the oil and set aside.\n2. Peel and chop potatoes in 3-cm cubes. Cut the capsicum in 2-cm squares.\n3. Heat 15 g mustard oil in a _kadai_ until it starts smoking and changes colour to a pale yellow. Temper the oil with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds.\n4. Once the whole spices start crackling, add the potatoes. Cover and fry them on medium heat until the turn slightly golden (about 4 minutes).\n5. Meanwhile, make a paste with ginger, cumin powder, kashmiri red chilli powder, turmeric powder, and 100 g water. Add it to the pan and cook it along with the potatoes until the smell of raw spices is gone. This should take about 6 minutes. If you find that the spices have dried out, add a splash of hot water and continue frying.\n6. Add capsicum and 3 slit green chillies. Cover and cook for about 3 minutes until the capsicum softens.\n7. Whip the yoghurt until it is lump-free. _Lower_ the heat and add it to the pan. Stir quickly prevent the yoghurt from splitting. Cook _uncovered_ for 2 minutes.\n8. Add the blanched peas (if you’re using raw peas, add them along with the potatoes earlier on) and sugar, and cook for 2 more minutes. \n9. Now add 250 g hot water to the pan. This will form the curry. Once it comes to a boil, drop the chunks of fried paneer in it. Bubble on medium heat for about 6 minutes until the curry thickens.\n10. Garnish with _garam masala_, _ghee_, and a slit green chilli. Cover the pan and rest it for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Fried rice](/recipe/bengali-vegetable-fried-rice/)\n- Polao\n- [Luchi](/recipe/luchi/)\n","source":"_posts/paneer-dalna.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Paneer’er Dalna\ntags:\n  - vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\n  - dalna\n  - paneer\ncategories:\n  - recipe\ndescription: >-\n  Understated, warm paneer curry with flavours of ginger, ghee and garam masala.\n  Rich and comforting without being flashy.\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1507834039/paneer-dalna-website-thumbnail-_cpit62.png\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: Lx50WRubCcM\ndate: 2017-10-12 20:30:00\njsonLd:\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"post-byline\">Bengali cottage-cheese curry</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Understated, warm paneer curry with flavours of ginger, ghee and garam masala.

Spinach contains a lot of soil and dirt. Get rid of these by first soaking it in water for at least 15 minutes, and then rinsing it thoroughly _several times_ before spreading it out to air-dry. Now, separate the leaves and stalks. If the stalks are long, chop them roughly into 6-cm segments. Pile the spinach (leaves and stalks) into a pan with 2 g salt. Cover and set it on medium heat to steam for around 8 minutes. The salt and heat will draw water from the spinach leaves, making them limp. \n2. Chop the potatoes, sweet potatoes, radish, and pumpkin into 4-cm cubes, and brinjal and sheem into 5-cm long pieces. \n3. Heat mustard oil in a pan. Add the bori and fry on medium heat until they turn golden (about 20 seconds). Remove from the oil and set aside. In the same oil, fry the brinjal until they are golden (4 minutes). Drain and set aside.\n4. If the oil has been absorbed by the brinjal, add about 10 g more oil to the pan. Temper it with dried red chillies, bay leave, and kaalo jeere.\n5. Add the potatoes and fry them on low heat, covered, for about 3 minutes. Uncover the pan at regular intervals and give them a stir, so that they fry evenly on all sides. Now, at 3 to 4 minute intervals, add each of the vegetables one at a time, in the following order: first, the sweet potatoes and pumpkin together, followed by radish, and finally the sheem. Throughout this process, keep the heat low, pan covered, and stir intermittently. \n6. Fry all the vegetables together for about 3 more minutes before adding the remaining salt (5 g), turmeric, and cumin powder. \n7. After another 3 minutes, lightly squeeze water from the steamed spinach leaves, and add the leaves and stalk to the pan. Cook on medium heat for about 6 minutes, before adding the sugar. Salt and sugar should, together, draw moisture from the vegetables. Cook them on low heat until the vegetables are tender (this should take another 10 to 15 minutes).\n8. Meanwhile, break the fried bori roughly into shards, and chop up the coriander leaves. Add bori to the pan, along with the fried brinjal. Cover and cook for about 4 minutes to allow bori and brinjal to soak up the juices. \n9. Finally, add a slit green chilli and coriander to the pan. Give everything one last stir.

Spinach contains a lot of soil and dirt. Get rid of these by first soaking it in water for at least 15 minutes, and then rinsing it thoroughly _several times_ before spreading it out to air-dry. Now, separate the leaves and stalks. If the stalks are long, chop them roughly into 6-cm segments. Pile the spinach (leaves and stalks) into a pan with 2 g salt. Cover and set it on medium heat to steam for around 8 minutes. The salt and heat will draw water from the spinach leaves, making them limp. \n2. Chop the potatoes, sweet potatoes, radish, and pumpkin into 4-cm cubes, and brinjal and sheem into 5-cm long pieces. \n3. Heat mustard oil in a pan. Add the bori and fry on medium heat until they turn golden (about 20 seconds). Remove from the oil and set aside. In the same oil, fry the brinjal until they are golden (4 minutes). Drain and set aside.\n4. If the oil has been absorbed by the brinjal, add about 10 g more oil to the pan. Temper it with dried red chillies, bay leave, and kaalo jeere.\n5. Add the potatoes and fry them on low heat, covered, for about 3 minutes. Uncover the pan at regular intervals and give them a stir, so that they fry evenly on all sides. Now, at 3 to 4 minute intervals, add each of the vegetables one at a time, in the following order: first, the sweet potatoes and pumpkin together, followed by radish, and finally the sheem. Throughout this process, keep the heat low, pan covered, and stir intermittently. \n6. Fry all the vegetables together for about 3 more minutes before adding the remaining salt (5 g), turmeric, and cumin powder. \n7. After another 3 minutes, lightly squeeze water from the steamed spinach leaves, and add the leaves and stalk to the pan. Cook on medium heat for about 6 minutes, before adding the sugar. Salt and sugar should, together, draw moisture from the vegetables. Cook them on low heat until the vegetables are tender (this should take another 10 to 15 minutes).\n8. Meanwhile, break the fried bori roughly into shards, and chop up the coriander leaves. Add bori to the pan, along with the fried brinjal. Cover and cook for about 4 minutes to allow bori and brinjal to soak up the juices. \n9. Finally, add a slit green chilli and coriander to the pan. Give everything one last stir. Turn off heat, rest the pan for two minutes, before serving.\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | roti\n- [Bhaja](/tags/bhaja/)\n","slug":"palong-shaak-ghonto","published":1,"updated":"2018-01-30T04:00:40.898Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjqrmmt8s005lyovh9d5kj9nz","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A medely of spinach with bright winter vegetables</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">Dry, mildly spiced spinach cooked with seasonal pumpkin, radish, broadbeans, and brinjals</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">P</span><em>along shaak’er ghonto</em> is a kind of <em>panchmishali torkari</em> in that it uses an assortment of vegetables—potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, <em>moolo</em> (radish), <em>sheem</em> (broad beans), and brinjal—besides the spinach (<em>palong</em> / <em>palak</em>).

It is sweet to the taste, flaky, and delicately flavoured. To top it all off, it is also extremely easy to eat, as it contains no bones besides the central skeleton. This recipe, _pabda machh’er tel jhol_, is a delicacy in Bengali cooking. ‘_Tel jhol_’ is the name given to a light curry, which is infused with _kaalo jeere_, green chillies, and mustard oil. Because it is sparsely spiced, this style of curry doesn’t overpower the star ingredient—the fish—but lets it shine on its own. If you have managed to procure a batch of fresh _pabda_, this should be your go-to _jhol_.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 30 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|                               Quantity | Ingredient                        |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                                  450 g | Pabda machh (cut and cleaned)     |\n|                                   35 g | Mustard oil (for frying)          |\n|                                    7 g | Mustard oil (for cooking)         |\n|                                    7 g | Mustard oil (for garnish)         |\n|                                ¼ tsp   | Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)       |\n|                               5 pieces | Green chillies (slit)             |\n|                                   25 g | Tomato (roughly chopped)          |\n|                              10 pieces | Dal’er bori                       |\n|                                  100 g | Brinjal (5-cm segments)           |\n| 15 g (plus ¾ tsp extra for marinating) | Salt                              |\n|  6 g (plus ¾ tsp extra for marinating) | Turmeric powder                   |\n|                                  ½ tsp | Atta (flour)                      |\n|                                    8 g | Coriander leaves (finely chopped) |\n|                                  400 g | Warm water                        |\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Electric kettle (optional)\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE INGREDIENTS**\n1. Smear the cut and cleaned _padba machh_ with ¾ tsp turmeric powder, ¾ tsp salt, and 1 tsp mustard oil. Mix till the fish are well coated, and set aside.\n2. Cut the brinjal into 5-cm segments. We need as many pieces of brinjal as there are fish—in this case, five.\n3. Roughly chop the tomatoes.\n4. Slit the green chillies.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE _BORI_, BRINJAL, AND FISH**\n1. Heat your _kadai_ well and add 35 g mustard oil to the pan.\n2. Once the oil is completely hot (that is, once it has begun to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow), add the _dal’er bori_.\n3. Fry the _boris_ for about 20 seconds till they are golden brown. They colour very quickly, so be alert while frying them.\n4. Remove the _boris_ from the oil and set aside.\n5. Next, add the brinjal pieces to the oil.\n6. Stir-fry for about 4 minutes till they are golden. Remove them from the oil and set aside.\n7. Now, in batches, fry the marinated fish. Fresh, sweetwater fish such as the _pabda_ do not need heavy searing. Fry them lightly to preserve their delicate flavour. A minute on each side should do the job.\n8. Remove the fried fish on a plate and reserve for later use.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING THE _JHOL_**\n1. Before we start, make a paste with 15 g salt, 6 g turmeric powder, and 50 g water. Mix and keep ready.\n2. Heat 7 g mustard oil in the _kadai_. (If the oil that you fried the fish in is not burnt, you may use the same oil to prepare the _jhol_.)\n3. Add the _kaalo jeere_, tomatoes, and 3 green chillies to the oil.\n4. Fry them for a minute on medium heat.\n5. Add the turmeric and salt mixture to the pan, and fry till the water in the spice mix dries up.\n6. Now, pour 400 g of hot water (either heated in an electric kettle or on the stove) into the pan. This will form the curry.\n7. Once the curry starts to simmer, add in the fried _boris_.\n8. Simmer for another 2 minutes before lowering in the _pabda machh_, one by one. Also add the fish drippings that might have collected on the plate that held the fried fish; they are delicious.\n9. Add the fried brinjal to the curry.\n10. Let everything bubble for about 5 minutes. As the curry boils, you will notice that the colour of the _jhol_ has changed from deep yellow to bright yellow. That’s when you know that the turmeric is cooked, and that the curry won’t taste of the raw spice.\n11. Now, pick one of the softened green chillies from the curry onto a small bowl. Add ½ tsp _atta_ to it, along with 1 tbsp of water. Mash the three together, until paste-like.\n12. Add this mixture to the _jhol_. The mashed green chilli will release the heat, while the flour will help the curry thicken and develop body.\n13. Garnish with 2 more slit green chillies, a drizzle of mustard oil (about 7 g), and chopped coriander.\n14. Allow everything to bubble for a couple of more minutes, before turning off the heat.\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n","source":"_posts/pabda-machher-tel-jhol.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Pabda Machh’er Tel Jhol\ntags:\n  - fish\n  - pabda machh\n  - non-vegetarian\ndescription: >-\n  A light, hearty, delicious delicacy, the padba macher tel jhol is packed with\n  the flavours of Bengal’s prized sweetwater pabda fish.\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1487900313/pabda-mach-website-thumbnail_hwdrvo.jpg\ncoverImageUrl: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1487900313/pabda-mach-website-thumbnail_hwdrvo.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: AMfGfjhJFNM\ndate: 2017-02-23 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Pabda Machh'er Tel Jhol\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1487900313/pabda-mach-thumbnail-small_ddzr4v.jpg\",\"description\":\"A light, hearty, delicious delicacy, the padba macher tel jhol is packed with the flavours of Bengal’s prized sweetwater pabda fish.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT15M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT30M\",\"recipeYield\":\"5 servings\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"450 g  Pabda machh (cut and cleaned)\",\"35 g  Mustard oil (for frying)\",\"7 g  Mustard oil (for cooking)\",\"7 g  Mustard oil (for garnish)\",\"¼ tsp  Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)\",\"5 pieces  Green chillies (slit)\",\"25 g  Tomato (roughly chopped)\",\"10 pieces  Dal’er bori\",\"100 g  Brinjal (5-cm segments)\",\"15 g (plus ¾ tsp extra for marinating)  Salt\",\"6 g (plus ¾ tsp extra for marinating)  Turmeric powder\",\"½ tsp  Atta (flour)\",\"8 g  Coriander leaves (finely chopped)\",\"400 g  Warm water\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

Smear the cut and cleaned _padba machh_ with ¾ tsp turmeric powder, ¾ tsp salt, and 1 tsp mustard oil. Mix till the fish are well coated, and set aside.\n2. Cut the brinjal into 5-cm segments. We need as many pieces of brinjal as there are fish—in this case, five.\n3. Roughly chop the tomatoes.\n4. Slit the green chillies.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE _BORI_, BRINJAL, AND FISH**\n1. Heat your _kadai_ well and add 35 g mustard oil to the pan.\n2. Once the oil is completely hot (that is, once it has begun to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow), add the _dal’er bori_.\n3. Fry the _boris_ for about 20 seconds till they are golden brown. They colour very quickly, so be alert while frying them.\n4. Remove the _boris_ from the oil and set aside.\n5. Next, add the brinjal pieces to the oil.\n6. Stir-fry for about 4 minutes till they are golden. Remove them from the oil and set aside.\n7. Now, in batches, fry the marinated fish. Fresh, sweetwater fish such as the _pabda_ do not need heavy searing. Fry them lightly to preserve their delicate flavour. A minute on each side should do the job.\n8. Remove the fried fish on a plate and reserve for later use.\n\n**STEP III—MAKING THE _JHOL_**\n1. Before we start, make a paste with 15 g salt, 6 g turmeric powder, and 50 g water. Mix and keep ready.\n2. Heat 7 g mustard oil in the _kadai_. (If the oil that you fried the fish in is not burnt, you may use the same oil to prepare the _jhol_.)\n3. Add the _kaalo jeere_, tomatoes, and 3 green chillies to the oil.\n4. Fry them for a minute on medium heat.\n5. Add the turmeric and salt mixture to the pan, and fry till the water in the spice mix dries up.\n6. Now, pour 400 g of hot water (either heated in an electric kettle or on the stove) into the pan. This will form the curry.\n7. Once the curry starts to simmer, add in the fried _boris_.\n8. Simmer for another 2 minutes before lowering in the _pabda machh_, one by one. Also add the fish drippings that might have collected on the plate that held the fried fish; they are delicious.\n9. Add the fried brinjal to the curry.\n10. Let everything bubble for about 5 minutes. As the curry boils, you will notice that the colour of the _jhol_ has changed from deep yellow to bright yellow. That’s when you know that the turmeric is cooked, and that the curry won’t taste of the raw spice.\n11. Now, pick one of the softened green chillies from the curry onto a small bowl. Add ½ tsp _atta_ to it, along with 1 tbsp of water. Mash the three together, until paste-like.\n12. Add this mixture to the _jhol_. The mashed green chilli will release the heat, while the flour will help the curry thicken and develop body.\n13. Garnish with 2 more slit green chillies, a drizzle of mustard oil (about 7 g), and chopped coriander.\n14. Allow everything to bubble for a couple of more minutes, before turning off the heat.\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)\n","slug":"pabda-machher-tel-jhol","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-30T02:29:28.346Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjqrmmt8y005vyovhgvgdre9h","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">A flavourful, light curry with <em>pabda</em> fish</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\">It is unbelievable that something with a handful of ingredients can taste so divine.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">T</span>he <em>pabda machh</em> is one of the most beloved of Bengal’s fishes.

Also known as _khejur patali gur’er payesh_ because it uses date palm (_khejur_) jaggery in solid form (_patali_) as a sweetener, this Bengali sweet recipe can double as a snack and an after-meal dessert. Whether you call it ‘payesh’ or ‘payasam’ or ‘kheer’, this is one of those quintessential Indian sweet dishes that transcends cultures and cuisines.\n\n_Nolen gur’er payesh_ (rice pudding with date palm jaggery) is made by boiling rice and milk together to produce a creamy reduction. It is a Bengali winter specialty since _nolen gur_ is available during the season. Used in a wide variety of Bengali sweet dishes during the winter months, _nolen gur_ brings a depth of flavour and smell, in addition to mellow sweetness, to whatever dish it is added. \n\nThe key ingredients required for making a good payesh are fragrant _gobindobhog_ rice (_notun aatop chaal_—new, freshly harvested, non-parboiled rice), full fat milk, and good quality _nolen gur_. The milk to rice ratio is quite high in this recipe (1 litre milk for 50g rice). The fat in whole milk lends creaminess to the _payesh_ and starch in ‘new’ rice helps thicken it. In case you can’t find _gobindobhog_ rice where you live, the ‘kalijira’ or ‘jeera samba’ varieties will also do in a pinch. \n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 60 minutes\n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n**CALORIES** 316 kcal per paratha\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                    | \n|----------|-------------------------------|\n|  1 litre | Full fat milk                 |\n|     50 g | New Gobindobhog rice          |\n|    150 g | Nolen gur (date palm jaggery) |\n|    ¼ tsp | Salt                          |\n|     20 g | Cashew                        |\n|     10 g | Raisins (soaked and drained)  |\n|     10 g | Ghee                          |\n\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Strainer\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n-  _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1.

The baking powder along with the Papad Khar help expand the papri when they are fried.</p>\n<p>Sodium Bicarbonate is commonly sold as baking or cooking soda in grocery stores. Sodium carbonate is known as soda ash.

Wash the rice thoroughly and fill your pot with water. As usual, we need at least five times as much water as the rice. For details, check out our video on <a href=\"/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/\">how to cook the perfect rice</a>.</li>\n<li>In the same pot as the rice, add some peeled and halved potatoes. This is so the potatoes are boiled at the same time as the rice.</li>\n<li>Set the pot on the stove and boil the rice for 10 minutes longer than you normally would—for this recipe, we need the rice to be soft and mushy.</li>\n<li>Extract the boiled potatoes from the pot. Strain the rice and set it aside to cool completely.</li>\n<li>Once the rice is cool, add regular water to the pot. The water level should be about 2 cm over the level of rice.</li>\n<li>Using your hands, gently break up the lumps in the rice.</li>\n<li>Cover and place the pot in a cool, dark place for 12 hours. This will give the rice a chance to ferment and develop good bacteria.</li>\n<li>While eating, take fistsful of rice from the pot and squeeze as much water out of it as possible. Transfer to a serving bowl.</li>\n<li>Using your hands, mash the rice thoroughly. Also mash in half a boiled potato along with it.</li>\n<li>Add some freshly squeezed lime juice, crushed green chillies, salt, and <em>kasundi</em> to the rice. Mix to combine.</li>\n<li>Next, add a couple of ladles of chilled <a href=\"/recipe/tok-dal-aam-diye/\"><em>kacha aam diye tok dal</em></a> and sliced onions, and mix well.</li>\n<li>Top off with some of the water in which the rice was fermenting. Mix again.</li>\n<li>Serve with fresh coconut slices, onions, fried red chilli, and green chillies. <a href=\"/tags/bhaja/\"><em>Bhajas</em></a> such as <em>alu bhaja</em>, <em>dal’er bora</em>, and <a href=\"/recipe/rohu-katla-fish-fry/\"><em>machh bhaja</em></a> go very well with <em>panta bhaat</em>, as does <a href=\"/recipe/alu-sheddho/\"><em>alu bhorta</em></a> (mashed potatoes with fried onions, garlic, and green chillies).</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Served-with\"><a href=\"#Served-with\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Served with\"></a>Served with</h2><ul>\n<li>Fresh coconut slices</li>\n<li>Raw onions</li>\n<li>Fried, dried red chilli</li>\n<li><a href=\"/recipe/tok-dal-aam-diye/\">Kacha aam diye tok dal</a></li>\n<li>Alu bhaja</li>\n<li><a href=\"/recipe/alu-sheddho/\">Alu bhorta</a></li>\n<li>Dal’er bora</li>\n<li><a href=\"/recipe/rohu-katla-fish-fry/\">Machh bhaja</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"title":"Parshe Machh’er Jhal Shorshe Diye","description":"Fresh parshe simmered in a potent and flavourful mustard gravy, this Bengali fish curry is easy to prepare and insanely delicious.","thumbnailImagePosition":"top","thumbnailImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1515124581/parshe-jhol2-website-thumbnail-_zvq0vs.png","coverMeta":"out","coverSize":"partial","videoId":"oTrxOqVd7-I","date":"2018-01-04T17:00:00.000Z","jsonLd":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Recipe","name":"Parshe Macher Shorshe Jhal","author":"Bong Eats","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1515124581/parshe-jhol2-website-thumbnail-_zvq0vs.png","description":"Fresh parshe simmered in a potent and flavourful mustard gravy, this Bengali fish curry is easy to prepare and insanely delicious.","prepTime":"PT15M","totalTime":"PT30M","recipeYield":"5","recipeIngredient":["400 g Parshe machh","10 pcs Dal’er bori (sun-baked lentil dumplings)","100 g Brinjal","15 g Tomatoes","8 g Coriander leaves","5 pcs Green chillies","20 g Yellow and black mustard seeds (soaked for 2 hours)","25 g Yoghurt (beaten)","40 g Mustard oil (for cooking and garnish)","¼ tsp Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)","15 g Salt (plus ¾ tsp for coating fish with)","3 g Turmeric powder (plus ¾ tsp for coating fish with)","8 g Sugar","300 g Hot water"],"recipeInstructions":["1.

The star of the show is, of course, fresh parshe. A freshwater catch with a soft sheen, parshe (a kind of mullet) is identifiable by its small, triangular mouth and slender shape.

Here, fresh parshe is simmered in a potent and flavourful mustard gravy. This Bengali fish-curry recipe is easy to prepare, insanely delicious, and requires only a handful of ingredients. The star of the show is, of course, fresh parshe. A freshwater catch with a soft sheen, parshe (a kind of mullet) is identifiable by its small, triangular mouth and slender shape. The fish is soft, flaky, and sweet to the taste—all of which are perfectly complemented by the fiery, potent flavours from the mustard gravy.<br></p></p>\n<p>This parshe macher jhal recipe is rather simple. The only finicky bit is grinding mustard seeds to a smooth paste until completely non-grainy. We’re using a mix of yellow and black mustard for a balance of flavour and sharpness. Besides fresh parshe, this recipe uses dal’er bori (sun-baked lentil dumplings) and brinjal, both of which soak up the flavourful curry, and provide a contrast of tastes and textures to this warm, comforting parshe macher jhol.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 45 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 5 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>400 g</td>\n<td>Parshe machh</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 pcs</td>\n<td>Dal’er bori (sun-baked lentil dumplings)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g</td>\n<td>Brinjal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Tomatoes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8 g</td>\n<td>Coriander leaves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 pcs</td>\n<td>Green chillies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 g</td>\n<td>Yellow and black mustard seeds (soaked for 2 hours)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25 g</td>\n<td>Yoghurt (beaten)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>40 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil (for cooking and garnish)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Salt (plus ¾ tsp for coating fish with)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 g</td>\n<td>Turmeric powder (plus ¾ tsp for coating fish with)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>300 g</td>\n<td>Hot water</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Mixing bowl</li>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan</li>\n<li><em>Khunti</em> | long spatula</li>\n<li>Lid for the cooking vessel</li>\n<li><em>Khunti</em> | long spatula</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n<li>Grinder</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Clean the fish, and coat it with ¾ tsp each of salt and turmeric.

Plan ahead since phirni has to be set for 24 hours. </p>","more":"<p>[<em>In this series, we tip our hats to some of our favourite dishes available in the restaurants, cafés, and cabins of Calcutta. Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city.

This particular style of phirni is popular in Mughlai eateries in Calcutta. No biryani meal is complete without phirni for dessert.</p>\n<p>After testing various proportions of rice to milk, milk to sugar, as well as testing with different types of rice, we have finally settled on a phirni recipe that is quick and easy to make, but tastes exactly like the phirni we have eaten in our favourite Mughlai eateries in Calcutta such as Aminia, Arsalan, Shiraz, Aliah, Shabir, etc. This phirni is made with very simple ingredients—rice flour, whole milk, sugar and flavouring agents (we are using saffron or zafran in our phirni). Our version is made without any condensed milk or mawa because we found that they don’t make any noticeable difference to phirni. We also like our phirni to be creamy and plain, so we have left out any additional garnishes.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 1 hour<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 5 servings<br><strong>CALORIES</strong> 234 kcal per serving</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>75 g</td>\n<td>Basmati rice (non-parboiled or <em>aatop</em>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 litre</td>\n<td>Full-fat milk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>75 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pinch</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n<td>Cardamom powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4–5 strands</td>\n<td>Saffron</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Heavy-bottomed pan</li>\n<li><em>Khhunti</em> | large stirring spoon</li>\n<li>Ladle</li>\n<li>Strainer</li>\n<li>Mortar and pestle</li>\n<li>New <em>maati’r bhnaar</em> or small, shallow terracotta dishes (to set the phirni in)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n<li>Grinder</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Wash the rice and soak it in water for 30 minutes. Be careful not to overwash or we’ll lose the starch, which we want to preserve for creaminess of the phirni. After 30 minutes of soaking, strain the rice over a colander and leave it to air-dry.</li>\n<li>Soak the <em>bhnaar</em> in water for 30 minutes as well.</li>\n<li>Once dry, transfer rice to a grinder and reduce it to a powder in 4 or 5 short pulses. The grind should neither be too coarse nor too fine. Take 1 cup of milk out of the total milk and mix the rice flour in it. Premixing rice flour with cold milk before adding it to hot milk will prevent clumping.</li>\n<li>Gently toast some cardamom pods in a pan and crush them to a powder. Sift through a tea-strainer to ensure the powder is fine. We need ½ a tsp of cardamom powder; we got ours from 4 large pods of cardamom.</li>\n<li>Heat milk in a heavy-bottomed pan and reduce it on medium heat for about 10 minutes. Then add the rice flour and cold milk mixture and stir immediately to prevent rice from clumping.</li>\n<li>Add 4 or 5 strands of saffron OR 1 tsp of kewra water (whichever you are using) to the pan.</li>\n<li>Continue reducing on low heat until phirni thickens. Keep stirring continuously, as that will help release starch and make the phirni creamy.</li>\n<li>Once the rice is cooked, add sugar and a pinch of salt. Don’t skip the salt—it balances the sweetness and makes a big difference to the taste of phirni! Also add the cardamom powder now.</li>\n<li>Keep cooking until the phirni reaches the right consistency. It should neither be too thick, nor too thin—when poured, it should just about find its own level.</li>\n<li>Transfer to the <em>maati’r bhnaar</em> or any ceramic or glass bowl to set. Cover the bowls/dishes with a plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 24 hours to set completely. The plastic covering will prevent the phirni from absorbing any ‘funny fridge smells’.

This is not a preparation in which you spice up things with ginger or cumin powder or red chilli powder. The only spice this recipe calls for is a touch of turmeric. Mostly, it relies on the salt and sugar to help draw out the moisture from the vegetables, and allow their flavours to mingle while cooked together. We don’t add water to form a gravy. Rather we cook this _torkari_ on low heat, with the lid on, for nearly 30 to 40 minutes. At the end of this slow cooking process, it reaches a state where no vegetable stands out, yet each has still held on to its flavours and integrity.\n\nComing to the selection of the veggies themselves, some type of starchy item such as a potato or sweet potato is used. These, being otherwise neutral in taste, are the perfect receptacle of the juices from the other vegetables. The mushy texture is usually contributed by pumpkin, while radish is used for the more sharper notes. Some kind of beans (such as _borboti_ or _sheem_) add crunch and colour. In the winter months, cauliflower lends the most sublime flavour to the _torkari_, in addition to providing texture. Finally, slimier vegetables such as brinjals, or cabbage or leafy greens that are prone to wilting on application of heat and salt, coat the mix with their juices and hold everything together.\n\nThere are several versions of _panchmishali torkari_. The choice of _phoron_ (or tempering) will depend on the vegetables used. In this particular recipe, we are using potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_ (yardlong beans), cabbage, and brinjal, with a tempering of _panch phoron_.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 60 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|               Quantity | Ingredient                                |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **OIL**                |                                           |\n|                   40 g | Mustard oil                               |\n| **TEMPERING (PHORON)** |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Bay leaves (whole)                        |\n|               2 pieces | Dried red chillies (whole)                |\n|                1 piece | Green chilli (slit)                       |\n|                  1 tsp | Panch phoron                              |\n| **THE VEGETABLES**     |                                           |\n|                  100 g | Brinjals (5-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  200 g | Potatoes (4-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  100 g | Sweet potatoes (4-cm cubes)               |\n|                  200 g | Pumpkin (4-cm cubes)                      |\n|                  200 g | Cauliflower (5-cm florets)                |\n|                  100 g | Borboti or yardlong beans (5-cm segments) |\n|                  100 g | Cabbage (5-cm segments)                   |\n| **THE SEASONING**      |                                           |\n|                  ½ tsp | Turmeric powder                           |\n|                   12 g | Salt                                      |\n|                   25 g | Sugar                                     |\n| **THE GARNISH**        |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Green chillies (slit)                     |\n|                   10 g | Coriander leaves (chopped)                |\n|                  ½ tsp | Bhaja masala                              |\n|                    5 g | Ghee                                      |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- Lid for the cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Peel and cut the potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin in 4 cm cubes.\n2. Cut the _borboti_, brinjal, and cabbage in segments of 5 cm each.\n3. Cut the cauliflower in florets, 5 cm large.\n4. In order to cook _panchmishali torkari_, the vegetables are stir-fried, and the order in which they are added to the pan depends upon their hardness. So, the potatoes and sweet potatoes, which are the hardest of all the veggies, are the first to enter the pan, followed by pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_, and cabbage. We deal with the brinjals separately, as explained in the next step.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Heat mustard oil in a pan till it starts to smoke lightly and the pungent smell is gone.\n2. Keeping the pan on medium heat, add in the brinjals and fry them for about 3 minutes till they are golden.\n3. Remove them from pan and reserve for later use. Frying the brinjals separately enhances their flavour.\n4. Now, in the same oil, add the tempering of dried red chillies, bay leaves, green chilli, and _panch phoron_. _Panch phoron_ is a mix of the following whole spices in equal proportion: fenugreek seeds (_methi_), fennel seeds (_mouri_), mustard seeds (_shorshe_), nigella seeds (_kaalo jeere_), and a typically Bengali spice called _radhuni_.\n5. Once the spices start to crackle, add in the potatoes and sweet potatoes to the oil.\n6. Fry these for about 3 minutes before introducing the next vegetable, that is, pumpkin.\n7. Fry the pumpkin, sweet potatoes, and potatoes together for another 3 minutes before adding the cauliflower. Basically, at intervals of 3 minutes, we add the next vegetable and stir-fry it together with the veggies already in the pan.\n8. Once the cauliflower is fried, add the _borboti_, and then, after 3 minutes, the cabbage.\n\n**STEP III—STEAMING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Once all the veggies have been fried, add in the salt and turmeric, and stir them in.\n2. At this point, lower the heat and cover the pan with a lid. The salt will help release the moisture from the vegetables, and gently steaming them with the lid on will help soften them up.\n3. Cook the vegetables like this for about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan. While doing so, be gentle, as the we don’t want the vegetables to turn into mush. (Always use a folding motion to stir the veggies around.)\n4. After 15 minutes, add the sugar and the fried brinjals, and cover and cook for another 10 minutes or so, stirring occasionally.\n5. You will know that the _torkari_ is done when the vegetables are completely tender and have integrated themselves into the dish, but still have the integrity to not fall apart to the touch.\n6. At this point, garnish with the chopped coriander leaves, green chillies, _bhaja masala_, and _ghee_.\n7. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and allow it to rest for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | Roti\n","source":"_posts/panchmishali-torkari.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Panchmishali Torkari\ndescription: Video recipe of authentic, vegetarian Bengali dish of cauliflower, beans, sweet potatoes, eggplants, cooked with panch phoron tempering.\ntags:\n  - vegetarian\n  - gluten-free\n  - torkari\ncategories:\n  - recipe\nthumbnailImagePosition: top\nthumbnailImage: >-\n  https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1485389957/website-thumbnail-panchmishalitorkari_t7jruj.jpg\ncoverMeta: out\ncoverSize: partial\nvideoId: DWY8qtUC9K0\ndate: 2017-01-26 09:00:00\njsonLd: {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Recipe\",\"name\":\"Panchmishali Torkari\",\"author\":\"Bong Eats\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1485389957/thumbnail-small-panchmishalitorkari_pexgac.jpg\",\"description\":\"Panchmishali torkari is any Bengali mixed-vegetable preparation, in which the vegetables are first stir-fried and then steamed in their own juices till they are tender and well-integrated.\",\"prepTime\":\"PT20M\",\"totalTime\":\"PT60M\",\"recipeYield\":\"5 servings\",\"recipeIngredient\":[\"40 g  Mustard oil\",\"2 pieces  Bay leaves (whole)\",\"2 pieces  Dried red chillies (whole)\",\"1 piece  Green chilli (slit)\",\"1 tsp  Panch phoron\",\"100 g  Brinjals (5-cm cubes)\",\"200 g  Potatoes (4-cm cubes)\",\"100 g  Sweet potatoes (4-cm cubes)\",\"200 g  Pumpkin (4-cm cubes)\",\"200 g  Cauliflower (5-cm florets)\",\"100 g  Borboti or yardlong beans (5-cm segments)\",\"100 g  Cabbage (5-cm segments)\",\"½ tsp  Turmeric powder\",\"12 g  Salt\",\"25 g  Sugar\",\"2 pieces  Green chillies (slit)\",\"10 g  Coriander leaves (chopped)\",\"½ tsp  Bhaja masala\",\"5 g  Ghee\"],\"recipeInstructions\":[\"1.

In this particular recipe, we are using potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_ (yardlong beans), cabbage, and brinjal, with a tempering of _panch phoron_.\n</p>\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 60 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 5 servings\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|               Quantity | Ingredient                                |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **OIL**                |                                           |\n|                   40 g | Mustard oil                               |\n| **TEMPERING (PHORON)** |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Bay leaves (whole)                        |\n|               2 pieces | Dried red chillies (whole)                |\n|                1 piece | Green chilli (slit)                       |\n|                  1 tsp | Panch phoron                              |\n| **THE VEGETABLES**     |                                           |\n|                  100 g | Brinjals (5-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  200 g | Potatoes (4-cm cubes)                     |\n|                  100 g | Sweet potatoes (4-cm cubes)               |\n|                  200 g | Pumpkin (4-cm cubes)                      |\n|                  200 g | Cauliflower (5-cm florets)                |\n|                  100 g | Borboti or yardlong beans (5-cm segments) |\n|                  100 g | Cabbage (5-cm segments)                   |\n| **THE SEASONING**      |                                           |\n|                  ½ tsp | Turmeric powder                           |\n|                   12 g | Salt                                      |\n|                   25 g | Sugar                                     |\n| **THE GARNISH**        |                                           |\n|               2 pieces | Green chillies (slit)                     |\n|                   10 g | Coriander leaves (chopped)                |\n|                  ½ tsp | Bhaja masala                              |\n|                    5 g | Ghee                                      |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n- Lid for the cooking vessel\n- _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—PREPPING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Peel and cut the potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin in 4 cm cubes.\n2. Cut the _borboti_, brinjal, and cabbage in segments of 5 cm each.\n3. Cut the cauliflower in florets, 5 cm large.\n4. In order to cook _panchmishali torkari_, the vegetables are stir-fried, and the order in which they are added to the pan depends upon their hardness. So, the potatoes and sweet potatoes, which are the hardest of all the veggies, are the first to enter the pan, followed by pumpkin, cauliflower, _borboti_, and cabbage. We deal with the brinjals separately, as explained in the next step.\n\n**STEP II—FRYING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Heat mustard oil in a pan till it starts to smoke lightly and the pungent smell is gone.\n2. Keeping the pan on medium heat, add in the brinjals and fry them for about 3 minutes till they are golden.\n3. Remove them from pan and reserve for later use. Frying the brinjals separately enhances their flavour.\n4. Now, in the same oil, add the tempering of dried red chillies, bay leaves, green chilli, and _panch phoron_. _Panch phoron_ is a mix of the following whole spices in equal proportion: fenugreek seeds (_methi_), fennel seeds (_mouri_), mustard seeds (_shorshe_), nigella seeds (_kaalo jeere_), and a typically Bengali spice called _radhuni_.\n5. Once the spices start to crackle, add in the potatoes and sweet potatoes to the oil.\n6. Fry these for about 3 minutes before introducing the next vegetable, that is, pumpkin.\n7. Fry the pumpkin, sweet potatoes, and potatoes together for another 3 minutes before adding the cauliflower. Basically, at intervals of 3 minutes, we add the next vegetable and stir-fry it together with the veggies already in the pan.\n8. Once the cauliflower is fried, add the _borboti_, and then, after 3 minutes, the cabbage.\n\n**STEP III—STEAMING THE VEGETABLES**\n1. Once all the veggies have been fried, add in the salt and turmeric, and stir them in.\n2. At this point, lower the heat and cover the pan with a lid. The salt will help release the moisture from the vegetables, and gently steaming them with the lid on will help soften them up.\n3. Cook the vegetables like this for about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan. While doing so, be gentle, as the we don’t want the vegetables to turn into mush. (Always use a folding motion to stir the veggies around.)\n4. After 15 minutes, add the sugar and the fried brinjals, and cover and cook for another 10 minutes or so, stirring occasionally.\n5. You will know that the _torkari_ is done when the vegetables are completely tender and have integrated themselves into the dish, but still have the integrity to not fall apart to the touch.\n6. At this point, garnish with the chopped coriander leaves, green chillies, _bhaja masala_, and _ghee_.\n7. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and allow it to rest for 2 minutes before serving.\n\n## Served with\n- [Dal](/tags/dal/)\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) | Roti\n","slug":"panchmishali-torkari","published":1,"updated":"2017-03-03T06:15:23.172Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjqrmmt9e006nyovh41cfzut2","content":"<p class=\"post-byline\">Simple Bengali mixed veggies with <em>panch phoron</em> tempering</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-intro\"><em>Panchmishali torkari</em> is any Bengali mixed-vegetable preparation, in which the vegetables are first stir-fried and then steamed in their own juices till they are tender and well-integrated.</p>\n\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">A</span>s you might have guessed, the stars of this dish are the veggies themselves.

Although Bengalis love their egg curry, the ‘mamlette’er jhol’ occupies a special place in their hearts. It is quick to make and requires ingredients that are usually on hand, or easy to acquire in a pinch. What makes the egg omelette curry special, though, is the promise of a warm plate of rice with a flavourful, spicy curry-soaked omelette and juicy potatoes. \n\nThis recipe shows you how to prepare extra-spongy, fluffy omelette. If you feel like taking your dim’er omelette’er jhol to the next level, you will not regret the extra effort in preparing these light, airy omelettes. But this recipe works just as well if you decide to make a regular, pan-fried omelette. Whether in a hurry, or just tired from a long, rough day, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a more soothing and well-rounded meal than ‘mamlette’er jhol’ and rice.\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 60 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 6 to 8 servings\n**CALORIES** 173 kcal per serving\n***\n\n## Ingredients\n|             Quantity | Ingredient                      | \n|----------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **FOR THE OMELETTE** |                                 |\n|                    6 | Eggs (separated)                |\n|                 80 g | Potatoes (boiled)               |\n|                 40 g | Onions (sliced)                 |\n|                  2 g | Ginger (finely chopped)         |\n|                3 pcs | Green chillies (finely chopped) |\n|                  2 g | Salt                            |\n|                 15 g | Mustard oil                     |\n|    **FOR THE CURRY** |                                 |\n|                200 g | Onions (sliced)                 |\n|                 30 g | Ginger paste                    |\n|                  5 g | Garlic paste                    |\n|                5 pcs | Green chilies                   |\n|                 60 g | Tomatoes                        |\n|       200 g or 6 pcs | Potatoes (5-cm chunks, boiled)  |\n|                 25 g | Mustard oil                     |\n|                3 pcs | Dried red chillies              |\n|                3 pcs | Bay leaves                      |\n|                4 pcs | Cardamom                        |\n|                 1 pc | Cinnamon                        |\n|                4 pcs | Cloves                          |\n|                ½ tsp | Cumin seeds                     |\n|                  2 g | Turmeric                        |\n|                  2 g | Cumin powder                    |\n|                  2 g | Coriander powder                |\n|                  1 g | Kashmiri red chilli powder      |\n|                 22 g | Salt                            |\n|                 12 g | Sugar                           |\n|                ¼ tsp | [Shahi garam masala](/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/)              |\n|                650 g | Hot water                       |\n\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Balloon whisk\n- 12-inch skillet\n- _Kadai_ | frying pan (with lid)\n-  _Khunti_ | long spatula\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Convection oven (optional)\n- Stove\n- Kettle (optional)\n\n\n## Method\n\n**STEP I—THE OMELETTE**\n1. For a spongy omelette, separate the whites and yolks of the eggs. \n2. To the yolks, add 40g sliced onions, 2 g finely chopped ginger, 3 chopped green chillies, and 2 g salt. Mix well.\n3. Boil, peel and roughly mash 80 g potatoes, leaving some lumps.\n4. Place a skillet on low heat and add 15 g mustard oil. Preheat the oven to 180°C\n5. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs just until they turn airy and opaque. There is no need to whisk them till the soft-peak stage; we just need an increase in volume. \n6. Now gently fold in the yolk mixture into the egg whites, deflating as few air bubbles as possible. \n7. Pour the mixture into the skillet. Place mashed potatoes in little dollops all over the egg mixture. Place the skillet immediately in the preheated oven for about 20 to 25 minutes, just until the omelette firms up. Be careful not to overcook the eggs, which can turn the omelette dry.\n8. Remove from the oven and cut into 6 to 8 section, depending on how large you want one portion to be.\n\n**STEP I—THE CURRY**\n1. Cut potatoes in 5-cm chunks and parboil them either in the microwave (covered with plastic wrap, for 3 minutes), or in a pot (about 15 minutes).\n2. Heat 25 g mustard oil in a _kadai_. Once smoking gently, temper it with the dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds.\n3. Add 200 g sliced onions along with the sugar. Fry on medium heat for about 8 minutes until the onions turn brown. The sugar will help the onions brown.\n4. Add the ginger paste and 3 slit green chillies. Fry these for 2 minutes, before adding the garlic paste.\n5. Add the tomatoes and sauté for 6 minutes until the tomatoes are soft. \n6. Make a paste of all the dry spices (turmeric, cumin powder, coriander powder, and red chilli powder) by adding 100 g water. Add this paste to the pan along with 2 g salt, and sauté the spices until their raw smell goes away. This should take about 10 to 12 minutes. When the pan becomes dry, add a splash of water and continue frying. \n7. Now add the parboiled potatoes, and let them cook with the spices on low heat for about 3 to 4 minutes.\n8. Add 650 g hot water to the pan. Once it comes to a boil, lower the omelette, making sure all the pieces are submerged in curry. Add 2 more slit green chillies (for flavour), and bubble on medium heat until the curry thickens. \n9. Sprinkle shahi garam masala, cover the pan, and turn off the heat. Rest for 5 minutes before serving. This curry tastes best on the same day.\n\n\n\n## Served with\n- [Rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/)","source":"_posts/omelette-curry.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Omelette’er Jhol / Omelette Curry\ntags:\n  - Egg\n  - non-vegetarian\n  - gluten free\n  - dalna\ndescription: >-\n  A special egg curry where the thick fluffy omelette soaks up the warm\n  ginger-garlic gravy.

Although Bengalis love their egg curry, the ‘mamlette’er jhol’ occupies a special place in their hearts. It is quick to make and requires ingredients that are usually on hand, or easy to acquire in a pinch. What makes the egg omelette curry special, though, is the promise of a warm plate of rice with a flavourful, spicy curry-soaked omelette and juicy potatoes. </p>\n<p>This recipe shows you how to prepare extra-spongy, fluffy omelette. If you feel like taking your dim’er omelette’er jhol to the next level, you will not regret the extra effort in preparing these light, airy omelettes. But this recipe works just as well if you decide to make a regular, pan-fried omelette. Whether in a hurry, or just tired from a long, rough day, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a more soothing and well-rounded meal than ‘mamlette’er jhol’ and rice.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 60 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 6 to 8 servings<br><strong>CALORIES</strong> 173 kcal per serving</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR THE OMELETTE</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Eggs (separated)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>80 g</td>\n<td>Potatoes (boiled)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>40 g</td>\n<td>Onions (sliced)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 g</td>\n<td>Ginger (finely chopped)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 pcs</td>\n<td>Green chillies (finely chopped)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR THE CURRY</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>200 g</td>\n<td>Onions (sliced)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30 g</td>\n<td>Ginger paste</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Garlic paste</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 pcs</td>\n<td>Green chilies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>60 g</td>\n<td>Tomatoes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>200 g or 6 pcs</td>\n<td>Potatoes (5-cm chunks, boiled)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 pcs</td>\n<td>Dried red chillies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 pcs</td>\n<td>Bay leaves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 pcs</td>\n<td>Cardamom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pc</td>\n<td>Cinnamon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 pcs</td>\n<td>Cloves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n<td>Cumin seeds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 g</td>\n<td>Turmeric</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 g</td>\n<td>Cumin powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 g</td>\n<td>Coriander powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 g</td>\n<td>Kashmiri red chilli powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td><a href=\"/recipe/shahi-garam-masala/\">Shahi garam masala</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>650 g</td>\n<td>Hot water</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Mixing bowl</li>\n<li>Balloon whisk</li>\n<li>12-inch skillet</li>\n<li><em>Kadai</em> | frying pan (with lid)</li>\n<li><em>Khunti</em> | long spatula</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Convection oven (optional)</li>\n<li>Stove</li>\n<li>Kettle (optional)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><p><strong>STEP I—THE OMELETTE</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>For a spongy omelette, separate the whites and yolks of the eggs. </li>\n<li>To the yolks, add 40g sliced onions, 2 g finely chopped ginger, 3 chopped green chillies, and 2 g salt.

A good pork momo is a joy to eat. </p>\n<p>This recipe for the momo filling calls for some very simple ingredients, the most essential among which is fatty minced pork, containing at least 30 to 50 per cent fat. If you are shopping for pork in Calcutta, just ask for ‘momo pork keema’ at shops such as UP Cold Storage (New Market) or Chaman’s (Beckbagan), and the butchers will be able to give you a mince with the ideal fat to meat ratio!

At the end of those 20 minutes you will have steamed rice, dal, and alu sheddho. Make yourself a hot omelette, if you care. Squeeze a dash of lime on your dal. You now have a meal so comforting, it will have numbed all your pain.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 20 minutes<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 5 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>15 g</td>\n<td>Mustard oil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Kaalo jeere or nigella seeds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 pieces</td>\n<td>Dried red chillies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 pieces</td>\n<td>Green chillies (slit)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 piece</td>\n<td>Bay leaf</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>½ tsp (or 1 g)</td>\n<td>Turmeric powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8 g</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>500 g</td>\n<td>Water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g</td>\n<td>Mosur dal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 g</td>\n<td>Coriander leaves (finely chopped)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Boiling pot | pressure cooker</li>\n<li>Beater | balloon whisk | fork | <em>dal’er kaanta</em></li>\n<li>Frying pan | saucepan | <em>kadai</em></li>\n<li>Ladle | large spoon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n<li>Pressure cooker (optional)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><ol>\n<li>Wash the dal thoroughly with plenty of water, making sure to rinse and repeat at least twice.</li>\n<li>Place the washed and drained dal in a pressure cooker with 500 g of water.

Popular on the Indian subcontinent, this snack resembles a pan-fried, ground-meat patty. It is best made with a lean, boneless red meat of your choice (mutton, beef, lamb, etc.). It is important that the meat has a low fat but high muscle content. Fat within the meat tends to melt the kabab when it is fried, while we want it to hold itself together.

We use a beaten egg to bind everything together. Depending on the recipe, such kababs may sometimes be coated in eggs or bread crumbs before they are fried.

Perfect for the colder months.</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<span class=\"dropcap\">S</span>teamed puddings are old-fashioned desserts that were common in England before households had reliable ovens. Steamed puddings lie somewhere in the middle of the cake–pudding continuum—neither as light and airy as a cake, nor as silky and moist as a modern pudding. We loved its unique texture when we tried it! This recipe is based on the original recipe in the book '[Anglo-Indian Food and Customs](https://www.amazon.in/dp/0140271376?tag=bongeats0c-21)' by Patricia Brown. We turned what was originally a carrot steamed pudding into a ginger pudding by adding ginger—both paste and candied. We also changed the proportions to match the sweetness and the texture that we wanted.\n\nSteamed puddings are commonly served with a custard sauce—crème anglaise—which we decided to infuse with tea. The idea of a ginger pudding with a tea sauce sounded perfect, and to our surprise it really works!\n\nSteamed puddings are traditionally made in pudding basins, which are made of metal or ceramic. Some have lids and some—like the one we are using—need to be covered with a foil and baking paper with a pleat that allows the pudding to expand. It also has a lip which lets you tie a string around it and create a sling with which the pudding pot can be safely lowered into and retrieved from the pot of boiling water. \n\nIf you enjoy the history of food and are not afraid to try something new you should try this recipe. \n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 3 hours   \n**YIELDS** 1 pudding (6 servings)\n\n***\n\n## Ingredients\n|                Quantity | Ingredient                     | \n|-------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|         **FOR PUDDING** |                                |\n|                   115 g | Salted butter (softened)       |\n|                   175 g | Brown sugar                    |\n|                       3 | Eggs                           |\n|                 2 large | Lemons (juice of 1, zest of 2) |\n|                   ¼ tsp | Gorom moshla                   |\n|                    50 g | Fresh ginger paste             |\n|                   ¼ tsp | Salt                           |\n|                   120 g | Plain flour (maida)            |\n|                   ½ tsp | Baking soda                    |\n|                   ½ tsp | Baking powder                  |\n|                   100 g | Carrot (grated)                |\n|                   100 g | Candied ginger (5mm pieces)    |\n| **FOR THE TEA CUSTARD** |                                |\n|                   150 g | Milk                           |\n|                    1 pc | Cardamom                       |\n|                     5 g | Ginger (sliced)                |\n|                    10 g | Tea                            |\n|                       3 | Egg yolks                      |\n|                    50 g | Sugar                          |\n|                   ¼ tsp | Salt                           |\n|                   250 g | Heavy cream                    |\n|                   ¼ cup | Brandy (optional; for flambé)  |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Pudding basin or a thick ceramic bowl\n- Cotton twine\n- Aluminium foil\n- Baking paper\n- Balloon whisk\n- Mixing bowl\n- Frying pan\n\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Weighing scale\n\n## Method\n\n### Making the pudding\n1. Grease the pudding dish with butter.\n2. Using a foil and a baking paper create the lid for the pudding basin. Don't forget to create a pleat to allow the pudding to rise. Follow the video to see how. Grease the bottom side (the baking paper) with butter.\n3. Cut a baking paper to the shape of the bottom of your pudding basin. Line your pudding mould with the paper.\n4. Sift together the plain flour (maida), baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl.\n5. Zest the two large lemons. Don't get to the white pith—it is bitter!\n6. Peel and grate the carrots.\n7. Chop the candied ginger into small 5mm pieces.\n8. Grind fresh ginger with twice the weight of water. You will need 50 grams of this paste for this recipe.\n9. In another mixing bowl whisk the room-temperature butter till it is soft.\n10. Add the brown sugar and whisk until pale and airy.\n11. Whisk in three eggs one at a time, taking care to mix one in thoroughly before adding the next.\n12. Now add the flavouring agents—lemon zest, gorom moshla, and ginger paste to the mixture.\n13. Squeeze the juice of one large lemon into the mix and whisk everything together. Now put the whisk away. We won't be using it anymore.\n14. Bring a kettle of water to boil. We will need this water to steam the pudding.\n15. Next add the dry-ingredients mixture, grated carrots, and candied ginger to the wet mixture. Fold gently with a spatula to mix everything evenly. Don't over-mix so as to not develop too much gluten.\n16. The pudding batter can now be poured into the buttered and lined mould.\n17. Cover the pudding basin with the pleated foil-baking paper lid. Tie a strong cotton twine all around below the lip of the basin. Now use another twine to create a sling. Watch the video to see how this is done.\n18. Pour the boiling water into a large pot placed on the stove. Lower the pudding basin into the boiling water using the sling for safety. Pour more boiling water into the pot to bring the water upto two-third of the height of the basin.\n19. Cover with a fitted lid and let this simmer on the stovetop. Make sure to refill with more water if the water level goes down a lot.\n20. After 1 hour 45 minutes take out the pudding basin using the sling. Uncover the lid and let it cool for two hours. Serve while still a little warm.","source":"_posts/steamed-carrot-ginger-pudding.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Steamed Carrot & Ginger Pudding\ntags:\n  - anglo indian recipe\n  - dessert\n  - pudding\n  - christmas\n  - steamed\ndescription: >-\n  Anglo-Indian steamed cake with ginger, served with a tea-infused crème\n  anglaise.

It also has a lip which lets you tie a string around it and create a sling with which the pudding pot can be safely lowered into and retrieved from the pot of boiling water. </p>\n<p>If you enjoy the history of food and are not afraid to try something new you should try this recipe. </p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 3 hours<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 1 pudding (6 servings)</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR PUDDING</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>115 g</td>\n<td>Salted butter (softened)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>175 g</td>\n<td>Brown sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Eggs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 large</td>\n<td>Lemons (juice of 1, zest of 2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Gorom moshla</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50 g</td>\n<td>Fresh ginger paste</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>120 g</td>\n<td>Plain flour (maida)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n<td>Baking soda</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n<td>Baking powder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g</td>\n<td>Carrot (grated)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 g</td>\n<td>Candied ginger (5mm pieces)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR THE TEA CUSTARD</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>150 g</td>\n<td>Milk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 pc</td>\n<td>Cardamom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 g</td>\n<td>Ginger (sliced)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 g</td>\n<td>Tea</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Egg yolks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50 g</td>\n<td>Sugar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ tsp</td>\n<td>Salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>250 g</td>\n<td>Heavy cream</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>¼ cup</td>\n<td>Brandy (optional; for flambé)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Pudding basin or a thick ceramic bowl</li>\n<li>Cotton twine</li>\n<li>Aluminium foil</li>\n<li>Baking paper</li>\n<li>Balloon whisk</li>\n<li>Mixing bowl</li>\n<li>Frying pan</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n<li>Weighing scale</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><h3 id=\"Making-the-pudding\"><a href=\"#Making-the-pudding\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Making the pudding\"></a>Making the pudding</h3><ol>\n<li>Grease the pudding dish with butter.</li>\n<li>Using a foil and a baking paper create the lid for the pudding basin. Don’t forget to create a pleat to allow the pudding to rise. Follow the video to see how. Grease the bottom side (the baking paper) with butter.</li>\n<li>Cut a baking paper to the shape of the bottom of your pudding basin. Line your pudding mould with the paper.</li>\n<li>Sift together the plain flour (maida), baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl.</li>\n<li>Zest the two large lemons. Don’t get to the white pith—it is bitter!</li>\n<li>Peel and grate the carrots.</li>\n<li>Chop the candied ginger into small 5mm pieces.</li>\n<li>Grind fresh ginger with twice the weight of water. You will need 50 grams of this paste for this recipe.</li>\n<li>In another mixing bowl whisk the room-temperature butter till it is soft.</li>\n<li>Add the brown sugar and whisk until pale and airy.</li>\n<li>Whisk in three eggs one at a time, taking care to mix one in thoroughly before adding the next.</li>\n<li>Now add the flavouring agents—lemon zest, gorom moshla, and ginger paste to the mixture.</li>\n<li>Squeeze the juice of one large lemon into the mix and whisk everything together. Now put the whisk away. We won’t be using it anymore.</li>\n<li>Bring a kettle of water to boil. We will need this water to steam the pudding.</li>\n<li>Next add the dry-ingredients mixture, grated carrots, and candied ginger to the wet mixture. Fold gently with a spatula to mix everything evenly. Don’t over-mix so as to not develop too much gluten.</li>\n<li>The pudding batter can now be poured into the buttered and lined mould.</li>\n<li>Cover the pudding basin with the pleated foil-baking paper lid. Tie a strong cotton twine all around below the lip of the basin. Now use another twine to create a sling. Watch the video to see how this is done.</li>\n<li>Pour the boiling water into a large pot placed on the stove. Lower the pudding basin into the boiling water using the sling for safety. Pour more boiling water into the pot to bring the water upto two-third of the height of the basin.</li>\n<li>Cover with a fitted lid and let this simmer on the stovetop. Make sure to refill with more water if the water level goes down a lot.</li>\n<li>After 1 hour 45 minutes take out the pudding basin using the sling. Uncover the lid and let it cool for two hours. Serve while still a little warm.</li>\n</ol>"},{"title":"Teto’r Dal Lau Diye","description":"This easy and nutritious moong dal, bittersweet and gingery, contains the goodness of bitter melon (korola) and bottle gourd (lau).","thumbnailImagePosition":"top","thumbnailImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1495744679/tetor-dal-website-thumbnail-_zt5gji.jpg","coverMeta":"out","coverSize":"partial","videoId":"EZMuX05_eGU","jsonLd":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Recipe","name":"Teto'r Dal with Lau","author":"Bong Eats","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmpeew57x/image/upload/v1495744679/tetor-dal-website-thumbnail-_zt5gji.jpg","description":"This easy and nutritious moong dal, bittersweet and gingery, contains the goodness of bitter melon (korola) and bottle gourd (lau).","prepTime":"PT10M","totalTime":"PT40M","recipeYield":"4","recipeIngredient":["100 g\tMoong dal","250 g\tLau (bottle gourd)","50 g\tKorola (bitter gourd)","15 g\tMustard oil","1 pc\tDried red chilli","1 pc\tBay leaf","½ tsp\tShorshe (mustard seeds)","½ tsp\tMethi (fenugreek seeds)","40 g\tGrated coconut","40 g\tGinger paste","13 g\tSalt","30 g\tSugar","8 g\tGhee"],"recipeInstructions":["1.

While the original recipe used pork, you can use duck instead of pork too.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>COOKING TIME</strong> 3 hours<br><strong>YIELDS</strong> 5 servings</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ingredients\"></a>Ingredients</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quantity</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Pork shoulder</td>\n<td>1000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR SPICE MIX</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dried red chillies</td>\n<td>5g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Whole cumin</td>\n<td>10g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Poppy seeds</td>\n<td>5g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cloves</td>\n<td>3g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Black pepper</td>\n<td>3g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Whole mustard</td>\n<td>5g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR MARINADE</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Garlic</td>\n<td>20g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ginger</td>\n<td>20g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fresh red chillies</td>\n<td>5g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tamarind pulp</td>\n<td>10g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Palm vinegar</td>\n<td>50g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Salt</td>\n<td>27g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FOR COOKING</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oil</td>\n<td>30g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cinnamom stick</td>\n<td>4cm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mustard seeds</td>\n<td>½ tsp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Onions</td>\n<td>300g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Turmeric</td>\n<td>3g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kashmiri red chilli</td>\n<td>5g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jaggery</td>\n<td>10g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Curry leaves</td>\n<td>1 sprig</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Water</td>\n<td>425g</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"#Equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Equipment\"></a>Equipment</h2><ul>\n<li>Mixing bowl</li>\n<li>Korai/wok</li>\n<li>Knife</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appliances\"><a href=\"#Appliances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appliances\"></a>Appliances</h2><ul>\n<li>Stove</li>\n<li>Grinder</li>\n<li>Weighing scale</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Method\"><a href=\"#Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method\"></a>Method</h2><h3 id=\"Making-the-pudding\"><a href=\"#Making-the-pudding\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Making the pudding\"></a>Making the pudding</h3><ol>\n<li>To create the vindaloo spice mix, dry roast Dried red chillies whole cumin, poppy seeds, cloves, black pepper, and whole mustard and grind them into a powder.</li>\n<li>Next, grind together garlic, ginger, fresh red chillies, tamarind pulp, palm vinegar, and salt to form a slurry.</li>\n<li>Cut the pork shoulder into 4-cm pieces.</li>\n<li>Marinate the pork with the dry spice mixture and the marinade slurry and leave it overnight in the fridge.</li>\n<li>The next day heat mustard oil in a pan until smoking.</li>\n<li>Temper with a stick of cinnmon and mustard seeds.</li>\n<li>Add the sliced onions and fry them until brown, about 15 minutes.</li>\n<li>Grind fresh ginger with twice the weight of water. You will need 50 grams of this paste for this recipe.</li>\n<li>Tilt the pan to let the oil pool on one side. In the oil fry the turmeric and the kashmiri red chilli powder until bright red. Stire to mix it back with the onions.</li>\n<li>Now add the marinated pork and fry on high for 10 minutes to brown the meat.</li>\n<li>Now turn the heat to medium, cover and cook for 20 minutes. The pork will start releasing juices.</li>\n<li>Chop jaggery and add it to the pan.</li>\n<li>Once you are happy with the colour of the sauce, add water (about 425g). (At this point you could also cook it in a pressure cooker to cook it faster. The flavour won’t quite be the same.) Cover and cook on medium until the pork is soft but still retains a bite.</li>\n<li>Once the meat is cooked and the consistency of the sauce is to your liking add the curry leaves, cover with a lid, and turn off the heat.</li>\n<li>Once cool, put the vindaloo in the refrigerator. Vindaloo is almost like a pickle. Like any braised dish it gets better with time. Plan to make this at least a day ahead so that meat has the chance to soak in everything.

Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city. Make these at home, or hunt them down from the source—irrespective of how you get your hands on these items, we hope you enjoy them._]\n\n<span class=\"dropcap\">T</span>ingmo or ting momo is one of those breads that is extremely satisfying to get right. The distinguishing feature of this steamed dumpling is its layered appearance. Once properly proofed and steamed, all the layers of the bun seem to open up like a flower. In this recipe, we show you how to knead, roll, and shape the dough in order to get a perfect tingmo. \n<hr>\n**A note on the yeast:** Yeast will need to be used depending on its type. Check the box/packaging to determine whether yours is an ‘instant’ yeast, ‘active dry’ yeast, or ‘fresh’ yeast. **Instant yeast** doesn’t need to be separately activated. It can be mixed directly into the flour and kneaded along with the other ingredients. **Active dry yeast** and **fresh yeast** need to be activated before they can be added to the flour. To do that, disperse the yeast in lukewarm water (in this case, about 145 g) along with the sugar (10 g). Cover and set aside for about 15 minutes, at the end of which, if your yeast is active, the mixture should take on a frothy appearance. Add this mixture to the flour and proceed as instructed. \n \n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 2 hours\n**YIELDS** 4 tingmos\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n| Quantity | Ingredient                   |\n|----------|------------------------------|\n|    250 g | Maida (flour)                |\n|      5 g | Salt                         |\n|     10 g | Sugar                        |\n|      3 g | Dry instant yeast            |\n|    145 g | Warm water                   |\n|   2 tbsp | Vegetable oil (for greasing) |\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Rolling pin\n- Steamer\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n\n## Method\n1.

Check the box/packaging to determine whether yours is an ‘instant’ yeast, ‘active dry’ yeast, or ‘fresh’ yeast. **Instant yeast** doesn’t need to be separately activated.

To do that, disperse the yeast in lukewarm water (in this case, about 145 g) along with the sugar (10 g).

Once such snack is the delicious (may we even say nutritious?) Kolkata-style vegetable chop, also known as ‘beet chop’ or ‘veg cutlet’. Best championed by patrons of roadside shacks, ‘telebhaja dokan’, and cabins, this popular and easy-to-make Bengali vegetarian snack is enjoyed with a simple salad of onions and cucumbers, and a dollop of kasundi. Full of the goodness of the seasonal beetroots and carrots, both of which are winter vegetables in Bengal, the vegetable chop (or veg cutlet) is crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and rather sweet to taste. It is a landmine of flavour and texture, which come from the veggies, spices, and nuts used.\n</p>\n\nIn this Bengali vegetable chop recipe, we recreate a Kolkata street food, which is also one of the most beloved Bengali snacks of all time. The main ingredient of this easy Bengali veg recipe is beetroot, which lends the chop its characteristic vibrant maroon colour. Besides that, this recipe also uses a unique blend of spices. Follow this video to learn how to make a Kolkata-style vegetable chop of the perfect texture and flavour.\n\n\n***\n\n**COOKING TIME** 90 minutes   \n**YIELDS** 16 chops\n**CALORIES** 141 kcal per chop\n\n***\n## Ingredients\n|               Quantity | Ingredient                        | \n|------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                  400 g | Beetroot                          |\n|                  200 g | Carrots                           |\n|                  400 g | Potatoes                          |\n|                    2 g | Cumin seeds                       |\n|                    5 g | Fennel seeds                      |\n|                  8 pcs | Cloves                            |\n|                  2 pcs | Cardamom                          |\n|                   1 pc | Cinnamon                          |\n|                  20 pc | Peppercorns                       |\n|                  4 pcs | Bay leaves                        |\n|                  4 pcs | Dried red chillies                |\n|                    4 g | Amchur (dry mango powder)         |\n|                   20 g | Coconut (sliced)                  |\n|                   30 g | Peanuts (halved)                  |\n|                  ½ tsp | Panch phoron                      |\n|                   30 g | Ginger paste                      |\n|                    6 g | Green chillies (finely chopped)   |\n|                   20 g | Salt                              |\n|                   35 g | Sugar                             |\n|                   10 g | Ghee                              |\n|                    8 g | Coriander leaves (finely chopped) |\n| **FOR BREADING CHOPS** |                                   |\n|                   30 g | Flour                             |\n|                      3 | Eggs (beaten)                     |\n|                  200 g | Breadcrumbs                       |\n|                 ~300 g | Vegetable oil (for deep frying)   |\n\n\n\n## Equipment\n- Boiling pot | steamer \n- _Kadai_ | frying pan\n-  _Khunti_ | long spatula\n- _Jhhanjhhri_ | perforated frying spoon\n\n## Appliances\n- Stove\n- Grinder\n\n\n## Method\n**STEP I—MAKE THE FILLING**\n1. Halve or quarter the potatoes and steam them until they are tender. Peel the skins and mash thoroughly. Steaming keeps the potatoes dry and fluffy.\n2. Chop beetroot and carrots into 3-cm matchsticks. Finely chop the green chillies and coriander. Divide the coconut into 5 mm chunks. \n3. Grind together cumin, fennel, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, peppercorns, bay leaves, dried red chillies, and amchur.\n4. In a pan, heat 30 g vegetable oil.

Allow the mixture to cool completely.\n\n\n**STEP II—BREADING AND FRYING**\n1. Divide into 50 g portions and form cylindrical croquettes about 7 cm long and 3 cm in diameter. Once all the chops are formed, it’s time to bread them.\n2. Dredge the chops lightly in flour and dip them in the eggwash. Transfer them on to a dish of breadcrumbs and cover them entirely, pressing them so that they stick. Repeat this eggwash-and-breadcrumb routine one more time to form a second layer of the coating.

Halve or quarter the potatoes and steam them until they are tender. Peel the skins and mash thoroughly. Steaming keeps the potatoes dry and fluffy.\n2. Chop beetroot and carrots into 3-cm matchsticks. Finely chop the green chillies and coriander. Divide the coconut into 5 mm chunks. \n3. Grind together cumin, fennel, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, peppercorns, bay leaves, dried red chillies, and amchur.\n4. In a pan, heat 30 g vegetable oil. Add the coconut slices and fry them until they are golden. This should take about 30 seconds. Remove them from the oil and set aside. Next, add the peanuts and fry them too until they are golden (about 75 seconds). Drain and set aside.\n5. Temper the same oil with panch phoron. Wait for it to crackle. Add the chopped green chillies and ginger paste, and fry for about 2 minutes. \n6. Follow these with the chopped beetroot, along with a large pinch or two of salt (to help soften the beet). Cook until the beet turns slightly limp, about 3 minutes, after which add the chopped carrots. Add the remaining salt and cook the veggies on medium heat until they are soft. However, don’t let them turn mushy or disintegrate, or we’ll lose texture.\n7. Once the vegetables are well done, add the ground spices, cover the pan, and allow everything to cook for about 2 minutes. After that, add the sugar followed by mashed potatoes. Mix everything gently until uniform so that the strands of carrots and beet do not break. \n8. Turn off the heat and add ghee, fried coconut and peanuts, and chopped coriander. Mix well. Allow the mixture to cool completely.\n\n\n**STEP II—BREADING AND FRYING**\n1. Divide into 50 g portions and form cylindrical croquettes about 7 cm long and 3 cm in diameter. Once all the chops are formed, it’s time to bread them.\n2. Dredge the chops lightly in flour and dip them in the eggwash. Transfer them on to a dish of breadcrumbs and cover them entirely, pressing them so that they stick. Repeat this eggwash-and-breadcrumb routine one more time to form a second layer of the coating. This will give extra crispy chops. You may prepare the chops up to this stage and freeze them in airtight containers for up to a month. Fry them as you need them—there’s no need to defrost.\n3. Fry the chops in hot oil (180°C) on medium heat until they are golden brown.

A tiny helping of this is served just at the beginning of the meal with rice. Such foods open up the palette to other more extravagant dishes to come. Uchhe or bitter gourd is also eaten during the spring when winter turns to hot summer in Bengal, and various contagious diseases such as measles and pox become common.
