    # Your biography (Markdown and HTML supported)
    bio: At Bong Eats we document the food of Calcutta. We cook traditional Bengali recipes prepared in home kitchens, as well as some of the most beloved dishes found in the myriad streets, cabins, and restaurants in the city. While we share some of the classic recipes with you (because who doesnâ€™t love shorshe ilish, chingri malai curry, and mishti doi?), we also bring you a whole host of dishes that are considered too humble for guests. They are eaten in the privacy of our own families, and provide as much comfort as they do nutrition. With Bong Eats, we hope to demystify such preparations and make them accessible to just about anyone interested in cooking and eating. This project is a labour of love. It is run by Saptarshi Chakraborty and Insiya Poonawala. All content on this site (including text, photos, and artwork) is copyrighted to Bong Eats.
