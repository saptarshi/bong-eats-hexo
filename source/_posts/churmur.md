[_In this series, we tip our hats to some of our favourite dishes available in the restaurants, cafés, and cabins of Calcutta. Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city. Make these at home, or hunt them down from the source—irrespective of how you get your hands on these items, we hope you enjoy them._]


<span class="dropcap">C</span>hurmur is a type of _chaat_ and one of the more inspired offerings to come out of a _phuchkawala_’s cart. It contains the usual suspects—potatoes, boiled _motor dal_, tamarind, green chillies, coriander, and a variety of spices and seasoning—all mixed together and heaped upon a _shalpata_ plate. From its onomatopoeic name that recalls the sound (‘_chur-mur_’) a crisp _papri_ makes when crushed to its vibrant amalgamation of flavours and textures, there’s nothing about this dish that is not delightful. When you are not ready to leave your _phuchka_ stall yet, but must, it is _churmur_—_puchka_ deconstructed—that you can take home with you in a paper bag. 

In this video we should you how to reproduce this astoundingly addictive _chaat_ at home.

## Equipment
- Pressure cooker | boiling pot
- Mixing bowl

## Method

1. Soak the _chhola_ and _motor dal_ for about 12 hours. Wash them after that. Drain the _chhola_ and set it aside. Boil the _motor dal_ until it softens but remains whole (it should not disintegrate). Drain the _motor dal_ and leave it to cool.
2. Boil the potatoes till they are tender. Peel and dice into 1-cm cubes, and transfer them to a mixing bowl.
3. While the potatoes are boiling, add 75 g hot water to the tamarind and allow it to soak for 15 minutes. This will soften the tamarind and ensure easy extraction of the pulp. Work the tamarind between your fingers to separate the skin and seeds. Press to squeeze out all the juice and discard the seeds. You should be left with some smooth tamarind pulp.
4. At this point, also roughly crush the green chillies using a mortar and pestle, chop coriander leaves, and slice the lime.
5. Back to the mixing bowl with the diced potatoes: add soaked _chhola_, boiled _motor dal_, chopped coriander, crushed green chillies, lime juice, tamarind pulp, salt, rocksalt, chilli flakes and _bhaja masala_. Crush the _papri_s and add them too.
6. Mix until everything is evenly combined. Use a light hand so that you don’t mash the potatoes or grind the _papri_ to a fine powder—we want them to remain chunky. Serve immediately.
