[_In this series, we tip our hats to some of our favourite dishes available in the restaurants, cafés, and cabins of Calcutta. Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city. Make these at home, or hunt them down from the source—irrespective of how you get your hands on these items, we hope you enjoy them._]

<span class="dropcap">T</span>his is a momo chutney recipe for the hot chilli sauce that is usually served with momos or kotheys. Besides the heat from the dried red chillies, vinegar lends it a slight tang and the garlic provides flavour. Just a dab of this is enough with each bite of the momo—it packs quite a punch.

We love juicy [pork momos](/recipe/pork-momo) and beef momos best.
