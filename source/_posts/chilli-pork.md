_[In this series, we tip our hats to some of our favourite dishes available in the restaurants, cafés, and cabins of Calcutta. Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city. Make these at home, or hunt them down from the source—irrespective of how you get your hands on these items, we hope you enjoy them._

_This recipe was very generously given us by_ [Doma Wang](https://www.instagram.com/doma_wang/), _who runs one of our favourite Calcutta restaurants,_ [The Blue Poppy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://g.co/kgs/qwgv2i&sa=D&source=hangouts&ust=1524108073846000&usg=AFQjCNGx1COMP6O7Pz-lixN1gFaxidqmKQ)_.]_

<span class="dropcap">C</span>hilli pork is one of the most versatile dishes in that it can just as easily double as a side dish to go with tingmo, rice, or noodles, as function as a standalone snack or appetiser. It can be cooked in several different ways. In fact, nearly all East and Southeast Asian cultures have variations of this popular dish. In India, besides the Tibetan and Nepali versions, the Goan, Mangalorean and Kerala-style chilli pork are well known (and who among us doesn’t enjoy the dry, dark Coorgi chilli pork?) .
  
We like our chilli pork juicy, where stir-fried pork slices are accompanied with hot green chillies in every bite. We’re using the pork belly as it is fatty, but you could also use the leaner shoulder. This simple recipe leads to twice-cooked chilli pork. The meat is first boiled until tender and then stir-fried. This recipe is also reminiscent of the chilli pork on the menus of several Chinese restaurants in Calcutta.
