<p class="post-byline">Boiled potatoes, flavoured with green chillies and a fat of your choice</p>

<p class="post-intro">This is the Bengali version of the mashed potato in its most basic form. It is made up of just four simple ingredients.</p>

<!-- more -->
<span class="dropcap">T</span>his recipe yields balls of warm, fluffy, buttery mash that you can eat with steaming rice and dal. While there are any number of ways in which you can boil the potatoes, for this recipe, we’ve found that cooking potatoes in an open pot of boiling water will get you the best results. You don’t want the potatoes to absorb too much water while they are cooking, as usually happens in the pressure cooker. In an open pot, you can always stick a fork into the potatoes to check if they are tender. Peeling the potatoes before you add them to the pot is also useful. It eliminates the need to handle hot spuds while removing their skins.

<p>Our favourite way, however, to cook potatoes for this recipe is to put the halved or quartered pieces into the same pot of water as your rice. That way, your _alu sheddho_ is ready at nearly the same time as your rice and there is one less pot to wash at the end of the meal.</p>
