<p class="post-byline">Orange lentils with onions and Bengali five-spice flavouring</p>

<p class="post-intro">Quick and light Bengali mosur dal with onions and a Bengali five spice tempering. Perfect for summers.</p>

<!-- more -->

<span class="dropcap">P</span>eyaj diye mosur dal, or Bengali orange-lentil soup with a flavouring of onions and panch phoron (a Bengali five-spice mix), is probably not something you would make on a weekly basis, mainly because it is not as versatile and neutral as a regular Bengali mosur dal (you know, the one with a kaalo-jeere-green-chilli tempering?), but it provides a nice change of palate once in a while. Like most Bengali dal recipes, this one is easy and straightforward enough to take no more than 15 to 20 minutes of your time.

## Method

1. Wash and rinse the dal thoroughly, and boil it in a pressure cooker with 550 g water. On high heat, one whistle should do the trick. Open pressure cooker immediately and beat the dal until the grains are semi-broken. Set aside.
2. Heat mustard oil in a pan, and temper it with dried red chilli, bay leaf, and [Panch phoron](/recipe/panch-phoron/).
3. Add the sliced onions and fry them on medium heat until they turn soft and translucent (about 5 minutes). Then add turmeric and fry until the raw smell goes away. 
4. Add the boiled and beaten dal, along with salt and sugar. Bubble everything on medium heat for about 6 minutes, for the flavour of the onions and tempering to permeate through the dal, before turning off the heat.
