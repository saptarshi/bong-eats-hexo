<p class="post-byline">A spicy cauliflower curry</p>

<p class="post-intro">A curry of cauliflower, potatoes, and peas that is a little hot, a little sweet, with hints of ginger, _ghee_, and _garam masala_.</p>

<!-- more -->
<span class="dropcap">B</span>engalis generally eat this beautifully spiced curry of cauliflower in the winter months, when the vegetable is harvested in large numbers. For this recipe, the cauliflower must be cut into chunky florets (about 5 cm large). Remember that the flavour is contained in the stem, so try to retain as much of it as possible. The florets are cooked twice—first stir-fried over medium heat to release some of their flavour, and then again with the spices and gravy. Even after all the frying and boiling, each cauliflower floret should hold its shape. It should snap when you run a knife through its stalk, and not disintegrate at touch from over-boiling.

## Method
**PART I—FRYING THE CAULIFLOWER**
1. Cut the cauliflower in large florets, about 5 cm large.
2. Heat 30 g mustard oil in the pan.
3. Stir-fry the cauliflower for 5–7 minutes on medium-high heat till they develop a light amber colour.
4. Remove the cauliflower from the pan and reserve for later use.

  **PART II—TEMPERING THE OIL**
1. Now, heat 10 g mustard oil in the same pan.
2. Add all the _phoron_ (dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds) into the oil.
3. Once the whole spices start crackling, add the cubed potatoes.
4. Fry the potatoes for 5 minutes on low heat.

  **PART III—SAUTEEING THE SPICES**
1. In a small bowl, make a spice paste by adding 100 g of water to ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and red chilli powder.
2. Add this mixture to the pan and cook on medium heat till the water dries off.
3. Add the salt, sugar, and another 100 g of water, and cook till the water dries off again.
4. Add the diced tomatoes and a slit green chilli.
5. Once the tomatoes have assimilated into the spice mix, add in the peas and fried cauliflower.
6. Cook the vegetables on low heat, with the lid on, for 3 minutes.

  **PART IV—PREPARING THE GRAVY**
1. Add 400 g hot water to the pan.
2. Cook the potatoes and cauliflower with the lid on for 10 minutes till the cauliflower stalks are tender. They should snap when you run a knife through them, but the florets should not disintegrate from over-boiling.
3. Garnish with ghee, garam masala powder, and a slit green chilli.
