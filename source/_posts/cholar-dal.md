## Method
1. Rinse the _chhola’r dal_ well and soak it in water for at least 2 hours. After this time, strain the _dal_ and transfer it to a boiling pot or pressure cooker. Add 700 g water, 6 g salt, and the bay leaves. Boil the _dal_ until it is tender, but the grains are still whole. The texture of this dish will depend a whole lot on how well the _dal_ is boiled. We want each grain of lentil to be perfectly cooked, but not turned to mush. On medium heat, our _chhola’r dal_ cooks to the desired doneness in 2 whistles. The time may vary for you.
2. Before you begin cooking, make a spice slurry by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder and 50 g water. Also, slice the coconut and slit the green chillies. 
3. Heat mustard oil in a pan (on medium heat) and once it starts to smoke lightly and changes colour to a pale yellow, add the thinly sliced coconut. Fry until the coconut turns golden brown. This should take about a minute. Remove from the oil and set aside. 
4. Temper the same oil with the dried red chillies, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. Stir in the _hing_, allowing it to fry for about 10 seconds. 
5. Add the spice slurry we made earlier to the pan. Fry on medium heat until the raw smell of the spices is gone. This should take about 6 minutes. Add the slit green chillies and raisins, and continue frying until you see oil leaving the sides of the spice mixture. 
6. Now add the boiled _dal_ along with the water to the pan. (If you feel there’s a lot of excess water with the _dal_, reserve some in a bowl.) 
7. Add the remaining salt (12 g) and allow the _dal_ to bubble until it thickens (about 6 to 8 minutes). Depending on how soft or hard your _dal_ is, you may have to adjust the flame and water accordingly. For example, if your _dal_ is still slightly hard, boil on low heat, adding water to maintain consistency, until it is cooked. If it is on the softer, mushier side (first of all, you need to make note of where you went wrong and try correcting the boiling time on your next attempt!), turn up the flame to thicken the dal quickly. 
8. Pick out a softened green chilli from the _dal_, mash it with the back of a spoon and add it back to the dal. Add the sugar and bubble for about a minute before stirring in the _ghee_, [_Bengali garam masala_](/recipe/bengali-garam-masala), and fried coconut. Allow the _dal_ to rest, covered, for 2 minutes before serving.
