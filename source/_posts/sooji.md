## Method
1. Heat the milk till it’s lukewarm (either in the microwave or on the stove).
2. Crush the cardamom pods roughly to release flavour.
3. Split the cashew nuts in half, lengthwise.
4. Heat ghee in a pan set on low heat.
5. Fry the split cashew nuts till golden brown.
6. Add the bay leaf and crushed cardamom pods.
7. Add in the semolina.
8. Roast on low heat for 4–5 minutes, stirring continuously for even cooking.
9. When the semolina starts to take on a slight amber colour and gives out a nutty smell, add the warm milk, all at one go.
10. Whisk vigorously for about 30 seconds to ensure that no lumps remain.
11. Add the raisins, sugar, and a pinch of salt.
12. Cook for 2–3 minutes till the sooji thickens. Stir frequently to avoid the formation of a crust on the surface. The longer you keep the porridge in contact with heat, the more it will thicken. If you prefer a runnier porridge, remove from the pan immediately. If you like it more well-set, turn off the heat and let it sit in the pan for another minute or so.
