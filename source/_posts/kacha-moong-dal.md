<span class="dropcap">K</span>acha Moog'er Dal is a light dal made with moong lentils that is ideal for the summer months when it is too hot to eat the more decadent [Bhaja Moog'er Dal]('/recipe/bhaja-moong-dal-shobji-diye/'). This is also different from the [Lau diye Tetor Dal]('/recipe/tetor-dal-lau-diye/') (dal made with gourd and bitter gourd) in terms of the tempering used—plus this is very quick and very easy to make. Just serve the kacha moong dal with some [aloo seddho]('/recipe/alu-sheddho/') or [aloo bhorta]('/recipe/aloo-bhorta/') and it makes for a simple but nourishing lunch.
