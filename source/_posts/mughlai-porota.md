<p class="post-byline">A layered, deep-fried pastry filled with egg and minced meat</p>

<p class="post-intro">Making this dish at home may seem like a daunting task. And we won't lie, it does require a fair bit of planning. But for the _mughlai porota_ aficionado, the pay-offs are enormous!</p>

<span class="dropcap">M</span>_ughlai porota_ is essentially a flaky flour pastry, filled with a mixture of beaten eggs, _keema_, spices, and seasoning. It differs from other stuffed _porotas_ in that filling cooks inside the _porota_, and that it is layered.

_Mughlai porota_ can be made at home with a little bit of organisation. Plan for the following elements individually, and in this order:</p>
1. **The _keema_**—This is an important component of the filling. We like to use cooked mutton or beef _keema_ (minced meat sautéed with onions, ginger, garlic, green chillies, turmeric, and _garam masala_). It needs to be prepared in advance.
2. **The dough**—This will form the pastry within which the filling is enclosed. Be sure to knead the flour and set it to rest for at least 30 minutes.
3. **The filling**—While your dough is resting, use this time to chop the onions, green chillies, ginger, and fresh coriander. Toast some peanuts and roughly crush them. Get the bread crumbs and salt out. Beat an egg in a bowl along with all the ingredients and your filling is ready to go!
4. **The sides**—_Mughlai porota_ is served with a cabin-style salad of cucumber, onion, and beet, _alu'r torkari_, chicken or mutton _kosha_, and some ketchup. If you want some or all of these sides, be sure to prepare them before your start making the _mughlai_.
5. **The _Mughlai porota_**—Now that the filling has been prepared, the sides are organised, and the dough has had time to rest, we are ready to bring all these elements together. See below for the full recipe.
