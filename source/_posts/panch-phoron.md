<p class="post-byline">Bengali five-spice mix for tempering oil</p>

<p class="post-intro">_Panch phoron_ is popularly used to temper dals, vegetables (such as [_panchmishali torkari_](/recipe/panchmishali-torkari/) or _shada alu’r torkari_), _chutneys_ (those with tomatoes or raw mangoes), or _achaars_ (such as raw-mango pickles).</p>

<span class="dropcap">T</span>he cooking of most Bengali dishes starts with the _phoron_. What this typically involves is heating up the oil (usually mustard oil), and once hot, adding a selection of whole spices to it. This 'tempers' the oil, transferring the flavours of the spices to it. This might seem like a tiny, inconsequential step (the process of tempering doesn’t take more than a few seconds), but no Bengali cook has ever skipped it. Is is what prepares the oil for cooking. In many cases, the choice of _phoron_ defines the flavour profile of the recipe (think of a dish like [_panchmishali torkari_](/recipe/panchmishali-torkari/), or a fish curry like _tel jhol_). There are myriad combinations of spices used for _phoron_ in Bengali cooking, and while that is subject for another post, here we look at the most definitive of Bengali tempering spices—the _panch phoron_.

_Panch phoron_ literally means five spices used for tempering. Apart from the Bengali cuisine, variations of this spice mix are used in Assamese, Oriya, and Nepali cooking as well. The Bengali version comprises _mouri_ (fennel seeds), _methi_ (fenugreek seeds), _kaalo jeere_ (nigella seeds), _shorshe_ (mustard seeds), and a typically Bengali spice, called _radhuni_. If you can’t find _radhuni_ where you live, cumin seeds make an acceptable substitute.

The _panch phoron_ is used like any other _phoron_. You heat up the mustard oil thoroughly, till it starts to smoke lightly and turns pale yellow in colour. You then add as much _panch phoron_ as the recipe calls for to the oil. The spices will start cracking immediately (mostly because of the mustard seeds in the mix) and give out a distinctive, bitter-sweet-anisey aroma. However, watch the _methi_ in the mix carefully; it tends to redden, burn quite easily, and turn bitter. So, always have the next ingredient in line prepped and ready, to add to the pan, and bring down the temperature of the oil.
