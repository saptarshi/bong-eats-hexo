<span class="dropcap">B</span>asanti polao or mishti polao is a sweet, ghee-laden rice dish made from fragrant gobindabhog or kalijeera rice, cashew nuts and raisins. This is the main rice dish of choice for any special occasion. Among the side dishes served with basanti pulao, kosha mangsho is the most popular. While there are many other kinds of polao made with different types of fruits, nuts, meat or fish, this one has become the most popular, featuring prominently on the menus of Bengali specialty restaurants such as Bhojohori Manna, Kewpie's, etc.

Use aged, non-parboiled (_aatop_) gobindobhog rice for this dish. New rice breaks very easily and will lead to a mash instead of perfectly cooked individual grains. We fry the rice before boiling it to enhance its flavours and break down the starch (which prevents rice from turning sticky). Also be careful of the amount of water you add. For 500 g rice, we’re using 1050 g water. However, as quality of rice varies widely, it is best that you reserve some of the water (5–10%) and add only if necessary. 

This polao tastes best the next day, so plan accordingly. Resting allows all the flavours to mingle nicely. It also ensures that all the moisture is absorbed by rice grains, leading to fluffier polao.
