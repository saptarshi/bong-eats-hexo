<p class="post-byline">A light hilsa fish curry with aubergines</p>

<p class="post-intro">What better way to enjoy the season’s freshest hilsa than in a simple, mild curry?</p>

<!-- more -->
<span class="dropcap">‘T</span>el jhol’ is the name given to a light Bengali curry, which is infused with flavours of _kaalo jeere_, green chillies, and sharp mustard oil. Because it is sparsely spiced, this style of curry doesn’t overpower the star ingredient—the fish—but lets it shine on its own. This recipe for _ilish machh’er tel jhol_ uses only seven ingredients, including the fish. Needless to say, it is designed to bring out the flavours of the fresh _ilish_ in all their glory. If you have under 30 minutes and a batch of fresh _ilish_, this should be your go-to curry

Ilish or hilsa is, however, is facing extinction due to high demand and overfishing. While [policy initiatives](http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/iucn_hilsa_study.pdf) between India and Bangladesh [are underway](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/india-bangladesh-seek-to-save-the-delectable-hilsa-113062700390_1.html) to tackle this alarming situation (hilsa conservation depends a great deal on water flow in the Padma-Meghna and Hooghly-Bhagirathi river systems), we can do our bit too. We can be mindful _not to buy any hilsa_ that is under 500 g / 25 cm. Catching of hilsa before the spawning stage is detrimental to the progression of the next generation. It is equally important also to _not buy hilsa during the breeding season_ (especially October to November, but even better, until March). In 2016, Bangaldesh was able to [increase its hilsa yield](https://scroll.in/article/806667/how-king-hilsa-made-a-comeback) by 50 per cent by putting measures in place to ban fishing in the breeding season. It also laid down and imposed specifications for net size to prevent the catching of juvenile hilsa. There is a need to create more consciousness about the importance of conserving a fish that is perhaps Bengal’s greatest cultural icon.

** How can you help? **
  1. Don't to buy any hilsa that is under 500 g / 25 cm. Catching of hilsa before the spawning stage is detrimental to the progression of the next generation. 
  2. It is equally important also to _not buy hilsa during the breeding season_ (especially October to November, but even better, until March).
