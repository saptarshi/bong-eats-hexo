<p class="post-byline">A sweet, milky, aromatic concoction steeped with orange pekoe tea</p>

<p class="post-intro">What better way to unwind your days with than with a steaming mug of _doodh cha_?</p>

<!-- more -->
<span class="dropcap">E</span>ven though commercial cultivation of tea in the country was introduced by the British in the early 19th century, there is nothing else that India has made more its own than its _chai_. A popular drink across most of South Asia, from posh drawing rooms to humble street shacks, this is a boiled concoction of water, milk, sugar, tea, and occasionally, aromatic spices. Ours is a lighter version of the famed “masala chai” (spiced tea), a perfect accompaniment to an evening snack, be it simple _moori-chanachur_ or something more elaborate. Make yourself this cup of “doodh cha”, not when you desperately need it, but when you feel like you've deserved it.</p>
