<p class="post-byline">A simple mash of potatoes, onions, garlic, and chillies</p>

<!-- more -->

<span class="dropcap">T</span>here is an entire category of Bengali dishes, the preparation of which involves boiling/steaming vegetables, leafy greens, and even certain kinds of fish, and then mashing them by hand with some sharp flavours derived perhaps from onions, garlic and chillies. This category is called the ‘bhorta’, and is admittedly more popular within the Bangladeshi branches of Bengali cooking than it is within the West Bengal ones. The mode of preparation is so simplistic—requiring only a handful of basic, affordable ingredients, and very little effort—that every cuisine has its take on the bhorta in some form or another (the Bihari aloo chokha, Bengali aloo sheddho or aloo bhaate, and the North Indian aloo/baingan/chicken bharta come to mind).

So an aloo bhorta, as you may have guessed, is a mash of boiled potatoes, and fried onions, garlic, and chillies. In this recipe, we’ve used both dried red chillies and green chillies, as well as some raw mustard oil for an added kick. Although this preparation doesn’t really warrant a recipe, no compendium of Bengali cooking would be complete without this quintessential comfort food. The next time you are tempted to reach for the take-out menu after a busy work day, be sure to remember to put together a simple meal of steaming hot rice, dal, and the simple aloo bhorta.
