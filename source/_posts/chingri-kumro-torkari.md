<!-- more -->

<span class="dropcap">T</span>he Bengali prawn and pumpkin curry, known as _kumro-chingri’r jhol_ or _kumro-chingri’r dalna_, is a light preparation best made with small-sized (7–10 cm), fresh/live prawns (_chingri_). The curry also contains pumpkin (_kumro_) and potatoes in chunky cubes, which get juicy with the flavourful _jhol_. This is a Bengali-style _dalna_ (curry), so it contains the usual suspects—whole garam masala, ginger, cumin, red chilli, and turmeric. However, the proportions of the spices here is dialled down to a great extent so as not to overpower the flavour of the prawns. 

This kumro-chingri recipe is so quick to put together that it can be prepared on busy weekdays to go with some steaming, hot rice. If you like the idea of a hearty Bengali-style prawn curry, with some nutritious pumpkin thrown in for good measure, you must give this recipe a try.
