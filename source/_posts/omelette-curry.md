<p class="post-byline">Bengali egg curry made with fluffy, spongy omelette</p>

<p class="post-intro">A special egg curry where the thick fluffy omelette soaks up the warm ginger-garlic gravy. One of our favourites!</p>

<!-- more -->

<span class="dropcap">O</span>melette’er jhol is a [Bengali spicy egg curry](/recipe/dimer-dalna/) prepared with omelette instead of regular boiled, pan-fried eggs. Although Bengalis love their egg curry, the ‘mamlette’er jhol’ occupies a special place in their hearts. It is quick to make and requires ingredients that are usually on hand, or easy to acquire in a pinch. What makes the egg omelette curry special, though, is the promise of a warm plate of rice with a flavourful, spicy curry-soaked omelette and juicy potatoes. 

This recipe shows you how to prepare extra-spongy, fluffy omelette. If you feel like taking your dim’er omelette’er jhol to the next level, you will not regret the extra effort in preparing these light, airy omelettes. But this recipe works just as well if you decide to make a regular, pan-fried omelette. Whether in a hurry, or just tired from a long, rough day, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a more soothing and well-rounded meal than ‘mamlette’er jhol’ and rice.

## Method

**STEP I—THE OMELETTE**
1. For a spongy omelette, separate the whites and yolks of the eggs. 
2. To the yolks, add 40g sliced onions, 2 g finely chopped ginger, 3 chopped green chillies, and 2 g salt. Mix well.
3. Boil, peel and roughly mash 80 g potatoes, leaving some lumps.
4. Place a skillet on low heat and add 15 g mustard oil. Preheat the oven to 180°C
5. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs just until they turn airy and opaque. There is no need to whisk them till the soft-peak stage; we just need an increase in volume. 
6. Now gently fold in the yolk mixture into the egg whites, deflating as few air bubbles as possible. 
7. Pour the mixture into the skillet. Place mashed potatoes in little dollops all over the egg mixture. Place the skillet immediately in the preheated oven for about 20 to 25 minutes, just until the omelette firms up. Be careful not to overcook the eggs, which can turn the omelette dry.
8. Remove from the oven and cut into 6 to 8 section, depending on how large you want one portion to be.

**STEP I—THE CURRY**
1. Cut potatoes in 5-cm chunks and parboil them either in the microwave (covered with plastic wrap, for 3 minutes), or in a pot (about 15 minutes).
2. Heat 25 g mustard oil in a _kadai_. Once smoking gently, temper it with the dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds.
3. Add 200 g sliced onions along with the sugar. Fry on medium heat for about 8 minutes until the onions turn brown. The sugar will help the onions brown.
4. Add the ginger paste and 3 slit green chillies. Fry these for 2 minutes, before adding the garlic paste.
5. Add the tomatoes and sauté for 6 minutes until the tomatoes are soft. 
6. Make a paste of all the dry spices (turmeric, cumin powder, coriander powder, and red chilli powder) by adding 100 g water. Add this paste to the pan along with 2 g salt, and sauté the spices until their raw smell goes away. This should take about 10 to 12 minutes. When the pan becomes dry, add a splash of water and continue frying. 
7. Now add the parboiled potatoes, and let them cook with the spices on low heat for about 3 to 4 minutes.
8. Add 650 g hot water to the pan. Once it comes to a boil, lower the omelette, making sure all the pieces are submerged in curry. Add 2 more slit green chillies (for flavour), and bubble on medium heat until the curry thickens.
