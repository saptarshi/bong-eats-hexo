<p class="post-byline">The Bengali variant of ‘khichdi’ made with roasted moong dal and fragrant _gobindobhog_ rice</p>

<p class="post-intro">_Khichuri_ is one of those rare dishes that effortlessly strides the boundary between what’s considered ‘ordinary’ and ‘special’ when it comes to cooking.</p>

<!-- more -->
<span class="dropcap">I</span>f there is one common thread linking the varied and multitudinous South Asian cuisines, it is _khichuri_. Essentially a porridge of rice and dal tempered with a handful of spices (that can vary from region to region), _khichuri_ can be as plain or as rich as you want it to be. It ranges from the mild, runny, and carefully spiced version for when you are under the weather, to the steaming and slurpy one for those wistful rainy days, to the thick, gorgeous, ghee-laden offering made to your favourite goddesses during _pujo_. 

Today’s recipe can double as an easy _bhog’er khichuri_, as well as a delicious, sustaining rainy-day meal. It is made with _shona moong_—little grains of golden _moong dal_ commonly found in Bengal. The rice used is _gobindobhog chaal_, a scented, short-grained variety with which _polao_ and _payesh_ are also typically made.

## Equipment
- Large _kadai_ | frying pan | boiling pot

- _Khunti_ | long spatula
- Colander or draining nets
- Electric kettle | saucepan (to heat water)

## Appliances
- Grinder | grater (to grate coconut)

## Method
1. Rinse _gobindobhog_ rice thoroughly, spread it it over a colander or net, and leave it to air-dry completely.
2. Cut potatoes in 5-cm chunks, cauliflower into 5-cm florets, and tomatoes into quarters. Shell and blanch the peas.
3. Set a _kadai_ on medium heat and add the _moong dal_ to it. Dry-roast the _dal_ for about 6 minutes or till it turns pinkish-brown giving off a nutty aroma. Stir continuously throughout to get an even roast.
4. Once roasted, transfer the _dal_ to a large bowl or saucepan, and wash it. Rinse just once; overrinsing will cause the _moong dal_ to lose its nutty scent. Strain over a colander and set aside.
5. Back in the _kadai_, heat 5 g vegetable oil. Add the washed _gobindobhog_ rice to it.
6. Fry the rice for about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently, till it takes on a glassy look. Frying activates the sweet smell of _gobindobhog_ rice. Once done, transfer the rice to a plate; set aside.
7. In the same _kadai_, add 15 g more vegetable oil. Fry the potatoes till they develop a golden film. Remove from oil and set aside. Add the cauliflower to the pan, fry till the florets are lightly coloured, and set those aside too.
8. In a small bowl, mix the ginger paste, turmeric powder, and cumin powder with 50 g water. Keep it ready. Also set water to boil on the stove or in an electric kettle.
9. Now, add 15 g mustard oil to the pan, set on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, temper it with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. 
10. Add the grated coconut. Fry for about 3 minutes until the coconut turns golden.
11. Add the ginger-turmeric-cumin paste to the pan. Fry the spices on medium heat till the their raw smell is gone and oil starts oozing from the mixture. This should take about 8 minutes. If you find during this time that the mixture has run dry, add about 50 g more water and continue frying.
12. Add the tomatoes, cover, and cook for about 2 minutes. 
13. Next, add the fried _gobindobhog_ rice, roasted _moong dal_, and 2 slit green chillies. Stir them into the spices and cook for about 2 minutes.
14. Add 1.8 litres of hot water along with the salt. Cover the pan and allow its contents to boil for about 5 minutes. The heat should be set at low from this point onwards.
15. Once the water is bubbling, add the fried potatoes and cauliflower. Cover and cook for about 15 minutes. _Dal_ tends to settle at the bottom and stick to the pan, so don’t forget to stir occasionally, scraping the bottom thoroughly. 
16. After 15 minutes, add the sugar, blanched peas, and 3 more slit green chillies. Stir everything in and cook for 3 to 4 more minutes.
17. Garnish with ghee and garam masala powder. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and allow the _khichuri_ to rest for 2 minutes before serving.
