<p class="post-byline">A light, flaky, puffed-up, deep-fried, sublime bread</p>

<p class="post-intro">We share with you the tips and tricks to making the perfect _luchis_, including a special hack for beginners.</p>

<!-- more -->
<span class="dropcap">L</span>_uchis_ are made from finely milled flour, as opposed to their close cousins, the _puris_, which are usually prepared with whole-wheat flour. Our recipe calls for a soft dough, reasonably well-hydrated, that should be kneaded for no less than 5 minutes continuously. With the proportion of the flour to water specified here, the dough may seem tacky at first, but fight the urge to add more flour to counter the wetness. Instead, continue kneading and the water will soon be absorbed into the flour.

Another tip that a lot of beginners would benefit from is this: allow the dough to rest at each stage—after kneading, after portioning, and after shaping the portions into little balls. This relaxes the dough, and makes it easier to handle. Finally, if you have trouble rolling out the _luchis_, try doing so between two sheets of well-greased baking paper. This helps apply even pressure, which is important if you want the _luchis_ to inflate when fried.

## Method
1. Place the flour in a bowl with the salt, sugar, and oil, and distribute the ingredients well by hand.
2. Add the hot water.
3. Set your timer for 10 minutes and knead the dough till it is soft and supple. The dough might seem a bit sticky at first, but take your time and knead it well, incorporating all the water.
4. Cover the dough with either a lid, wet towel, or plastic wrap, and allow it to rest for at least 30 minutes.
5. Portion the dough in 20 equal balls of 16–17 g each.
6. Shape each portion of the dough into a round ball. Resting the dough for 5 minutes each before shaping and rolling will make the job easier.
7. Roll each ball into a disc of about 10 cm in diameter. Beginners may roll out the _luchis_ between two sheets of well-oiled baking paper. This will help apply pressure evenly.
8. Lower the discs into hot oil set over medium heat and fry the _luchis_ one at a time, gently patting their tops with the flat end of your frying spoon to make them puff.
9. Drain the fried _luchis_ on a rack, colander, or over paper towels.
