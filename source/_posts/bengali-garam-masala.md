<p class="post-byline">A fragrant blend of three simple spices</p>

<p class="post-intro">_Garam masala_ is an important component of much of South Asian cooking. It is a blend of whole spices, whose proportions vary from cuisine to cuisine. The Bengali version comprises three simple spices—cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves.</p>

<span class="dropcap">W</span>hile the _garam masala_ used in most northern and western Indian cooking might contain everything from coriander and cumin seeds to mustard seeds, the Bengali version, in its most basic form, is made up of cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves. The preparation is simple. We dry-roast a blend of the whole spices to awaken their dormant flavours and powder them—either by hand on in an electric grinder. If stored in an airtight container, the _masala_ can keep for months.  

In Bengali cooking, _garam masala_ is used to flavour egg, chicken, mutton, lamb, or beef curries. Along with _ghee_, it is also used as garnish for several vegetarian preparations (most _ghontos_ and [_dalnas_](/tags/dalna/ "Bengali dalna recipes"), _khichuri_, and _panchmishali torkari_). This spice is particularly handy if you want to quickly refresh leftovers. Just add a pinch of it (along with a sliver of _ghee_) to your day-old _torkari_ while reheating, and no one need be any the wiser!
