## Equipment
- Boiling pot | pressure cooker
- Beater | balloon whisk | fork | _dal'er kaanta_
- Frying pan | saucepan | _kadai_
- Ladle | Large spoon

## Appliances
- Stove
- Pressure cooker (optional)

## Method
1. Wash the dal thoroughly with plenty of water, making sure to rinse and repeat at least twice.
2. Place the washed and drained dal in a pressure cooker with 550 g of water. You can also cook the dal over the stove in a lidded pot, but make sure to take 650 g of water instead of 550 g to compensate for evaporation.
3. Boil till you see the broken grains of dal. If using a pressure cooker, cook on medium-high heat till you hear the first whistle. Turn off the heat and let the pressure release on its own.
4. Whisk the boiled dal with a beater till you can no longer see the individual grains.
5. Heat oil in a pan.
6. Temper it with the dried red chillies, mustard seeds, and half of the curry leaves.
7. Add the tomatoes, salt, and turmeric, and cook on low heat till the tomatoes are softened.
8. Add in the whisked dal.
9. Add the sugar and the remaining curry leaves.
10. Allow the dal to boil on medium heat for 5–7 minutes.
