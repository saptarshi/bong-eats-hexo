<p class="post-byline">A thin, delicate crêpe filled with sweetened, reduced milk or _kheer_</p>

<p class="post-intro">Winter is a Bengali's favourite season. And what would winters in Bengal be without all the sweet _pithe_?</p>

<!-- more -->
<span class="dropcap">T</span>he rice-harvest festival in Bengal, _poush sankranti_, is celebrated by making the most wondrous of sweets—the pithe. This is an umbrella term used to describe a variety of items prepared using rice, date-palm syrup (_patali gur_, only available in winter), coconut, milk, and flour. _Pithe_ is no single dish, but a category of sweets that are part of the Bengali cooking tradition dedicated exclusively to turning the season’s harvest into delectable foods.

_Patishapta_ is a type of _pithe_. It is a light crêpe filled with either _kheer_ or a coconut-and-_gur_ mixture. In this recipe, we show you how to make the version with _kheer_.

## Method
**STEP I—MAKE THE CRÊPE BATTER**
1. Add the rice grains to an electric grinder and blitz them to a fine powder. You now have rice flour.
2. In a mixing bowl, add the _maida_ (75 g), _sooji_ (30 g), rice flour (10 g), sugar (30 g), salt (¼ tsp), and milk (280 g).
3. Mix the ingredients together till they are more or less combined. Do not over-mix or your crêpes may turn out chewy.
4. Cover the batter and set it aside to rest, for 2 hours. This will allow time for the _sooji_ to swell up and the sugar to melt.
5. While your batter is resting, prepare the _kheer_, which will form the filling for our _patishapta_.

**STEP II—MAKE THE _KHEER_ [WATCH HOW TO MAKE _KHEER_](https://youtu.be/PzFXjD8D3AY?list=PLGX3dcCcJDYweaL6mlxJ54UAoKZAjNluz)**
1. Take 1.5 kg milk in a heavy-bottom saucepan and set it to boil.
2. Once bubbling, stir in 65 g sugar.
3. Keep boiling the milk, while stirring it continuously, for about 90 minutes.
4. During this entire time, the pot should be on medium to low heat.
5. At regular intervals of 3–4 minutes, be sure to scrape the solids from the bottom and sides of the pot, and incorporate it into the boiling milk. This step, as well as the previous one, is crucial. We don’t want our _kheer_ to burn at any point.
6. Once the milk has thickened such that when you lift some of it on your spoon and drop it, it falls in clumps, make a paste of 1 tsp flour and 1 tbsp milk.
7. Add this paste to the pot. Stir and cook for another 5 minutes.
8. Allow the _kheer_ to cool before proceeding to the next stage.

**STEP III—MAKE THE _PATISHAPTA_**
1. Divide the _kheer_ in equal portions of 22 g each.
2. Give your batter a quick stir till it is uniform.
3. Now, set a non-stick pan on medium-low flame and allow it to heat up completely.
4. Once the pan is hot, smear it with a very, _very_ light coating of _ghee_ (remember, we are already using a non-stick pan).
5. Using a ladle, take about 25 g of the batter and drop it in the centre of the pan.
6. Swirl it around gradually to form a thin crêpe, about 12 cm in diameter.
7. Roll a portion of the _kheer_ between your palms to form a log (about 8 cm long), and flatten it with your fingers.
8. Place it at one end of the crêpe and start folding the crêpe into a roll, with the help of a spatula. [Note that we are cooking only one side of the crêpe.]
9. Transfer the _patishapta_ from the pan to a plate and proceed making the rest. These can be eaten hot, or they can be cooled and stored in the refrigerator for up to 7 days.
