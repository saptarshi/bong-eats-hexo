<p class="post-byline">A light pumpkin curry with coconut, green chillies and nigella seeds</p>

<p class="post-intro">This light yet vibrant curry is probably unlike anything you’ve ever tasted.</p>

<!-- more -->
<span class="dropcap">A</span> [_jhal_](/tags/jhal) is a type of Bengali curry characterised by the sharpness of its flavours, unlike its close cousin, the _jhol_, which is usually more mellow. This recipe, _kumro’r jhal_, is defined by the heat and aroma that comes from freshly crushed green chillies and _kaalo jeere_. In a way, the green chilli and _kaalo jeere_ combination is a timeless one when it comes to Bengali cooking—these two work hand-in-hand to temper several classic dishes. In this recipe, these are not only used as _phoron_ but they are also pasted and added to the curry itself. Apart from that, this unusual _jhal_ recipe also makes use of coconut paste, some milk, and a pinch of flour, all of which render a light, yet creamy, gravy. This dish is extremely easy to make (it doesn’t require you to spend several minutes sauteing spices) and can be knocked out in under 30 minutes.

## Method
1. Peel the pumpkin and cut it into 4-cm-large cubes.
2. Transfer the cubes to a saucepan. Add 200 g water and 10 g salt. Cover and boil the pumpkin till it is 90 per cent tender. This should take roughly about 10 minutes. Do not drain the water, as we’ll need it later to form the curry.
3. While the pumpkin is boiling, crush ¼ tsp _kaalo jeere_ and 1 green chilli with a pinch of salt using a _sheel-nora_ or mortar and pestle. _Kaalo jeere_ and green chillies are the main flavours of this dish, so make sure they are freshly crushed.
4. Also make some coconut paste using a grinder or _sheel-nora_
5. Now, heat 15 g mustard oil in a pan. Once it starts to smoke lightly and changes colour to a pale yellow, temper it with 2 dried red chillies, 1 bay leaf, 1 green chilli, and ⅛ tsp _kalo jeere_.
6. Next, add the boiled pumpkin along with the water.
7. Then add the pasted coconut and stir it in.
8. Bubble for a minute before adding the crushed _kaalo jeere_ and green chillies mixture. Also add the sugar at this point.
9. Mix the _maida_ into the milk, and add the solution to the pan. Let everything boil for about 4 to 5 minutes, so that the _maida_ can help thicken the gravy slightly, before turning off the heat.
