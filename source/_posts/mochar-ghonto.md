<span class="dropcap">M</span>ocha’r ghonto is special to anyone who has grown up in Bengal. Mocha is the banana blossom. The niramish (vegetarian) mocha'r ghonto with narkel (coconut) and chhola (Bengal gram) is loved as much as mocha chingri garnished with small freshwater prawns. In this video, we show methods of preparing both mocha’r ghonto as well as mocha with chingri. This also includes a very easy, step-by-step guide to cleaning, preparing and cutting mocha. Like any Bengali niramish recipe, this one uses no onion or garlic—the main flavours come from ginger, cumin, ghee and garam masala. Mocha provides a crunchy texture that is a canvas for all these flavours. Give this Bengali recipe of mocha a try. It is not the best looking dish, but once you taste mocha, it will change your life.

## Method

1. Clean and cut mocha [as shown in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4Igr5VwEEQ). A 550 g whole mocha roughly yields 300 to 350 g edible mocha. 
2. Add chopped mocha to a pressure cooker with 10 g salt, ½ tsp turmeric, and 650 g water. Pressure cook on medium heat for one whistle and then allow the steam to release naturally. 
3. Open the pressure cooker and strain the mocha over a net or colander. Once cool to the touch (in about 30 minutes), gently mash the mocha to get a mix of mushy and crunchy textures.
4. Heat mustard oil in a pan. If using prawns, coat them in a pinch of salt and turmeric, and fry them on medium heat for about 45 seconds. Remove from the oil and set aside. 
5. To the same oil, add a tempering of dried red chilli, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. Once crackling, add the cubed potatoes and fry until golden (about 4 minutes). 
6. Add grated coconut and fry for a minute before adding a slurry of spices made by mixing ginger paste, cumin powder, ½ tsp turmeric powder, and red chilli powder with 50 g water. Sauté the spices until they release oil. This should take about 10 minutes or so. Whenever the pan becomes dry, add a splash of water and continue frying. 
7. Add green chillies and soaked chhola (if using). Sauté for another 3 minutes before adding boiled mocha.
8. Add salt and sugar. Sauté mocha with the spices for about 6 minutes on low heat. If the mocha becomes too dry, you may also add 1 tbsp of milk. 
9. Add the fried prawns and/or dal’er bora (whichever you are using) and cook for 2 minutes to allow the flavours to mingle. Finish with ghee and garam masala.
