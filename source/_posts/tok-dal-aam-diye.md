<span class="dropcap">A</span>s spring turns to summer in the lower-Gangetic plains, people start preparing for the oppressive heat of the months to come. Cooling foods slowly start getting incorporated into the diet to combat the rising temperatures. But perhaps nothing signals the arrival of spring in Bengal more than the _kalboishakhis_ (nor'westers)—late-afternoon thunderstorms that are localized to the region. One byproduct of this storm is that it causes a lot of mangoes to prematurely fall off trees. While that is not good news for ardent lovers of this fleshy, tropical fruit, it gives us an opportunity to prepare a rather delightful _tok dal_ out of the unripe, sour, green mangoes.

## Method

1. Wash and rinse the [_mosur dal_](/tags/mosur-dal/), and place it in a pressure cooker or boiling pot, with 650 g water. Boil the _dal_ till it is soft, but not mushy. If using a pressure cooker, boil for one whistle, and then release the steam immediately to stop the lentils from cooking any further.
2. Peel the unripe mango, and divide it into wedges, 2 cm thick. Reserve the cut pieces in a bowl of water till needed, to prevent the mangoes from oxidizing.
3. Heat a _kadai_ and add 15 g mustard oil to it.
4. Temper the oil with the dried red chilli, green chillies, and mustard seeds.
5. Once the mustard seeds start to crackle, add the mango wedges, followed by about 2 g of salt.
6. Stir the salt in, cover the pan, and allow the mangoes to cook on low heat for about 5 minutes. The salt will help the mangoes soften. Stir occasionally to prevent the mangoes from sticking to the pan.
7. Once the mangoes are soft, add the boiled _dal_, turmeric powder, sugar, and rest of the salt.
8. Allow everything to bubble on medium heat for about 6 minutes. During this time, the mangoes will release their tartness into the _dal_.
9. This dish is sweet and tangy. Depending on the sourness of your mango, mash some of the softened pieces to a pulp and mix them with the dal.
10. Boil for another 2 minutes before turning off the heat.
