<p class="post-byline">A spicy, dry bottle-gourd curry</p>

<p class="post-intro">This bottle-gourd preparation is mellow, spicy, and nutty, all at the same time.</p>

<!-- more -->
<span class="dropcap">L</span>_au’er [ghonto](/tags/ghonto/)_ is a dry, hot-and-spicy curry that is prepared by steaming the bottle gourd in its own juices. This dish benefits from a low-and-slow cooking method, which really helps draw out all the flavours of the _lau_. The vegetable is to be cut into about 3-mm-wide matchsticks. Larger pieces will not only fail to yield curry of the desired texture, but will also prevent the seasoning and spices from entering the _lau_. Throughout the cooking process, keep the heat low and the pan covered. Stir occasionally to ensure that the _lau_ doesn’t stick to the pan. In this version of the _lau’er ghonto_, besides the usual suspects (ginger, cumin powder, [_garam masala_](/recipe/bengali-garam-masala/), etc.), we have also added some roasted _moong dal_ and fried _dal’er bori_. Both of these lend the preparation an amazing nutty undertone, along with a subtle bit of crunch. This dish can be absolutely delightful if prepared right.

## Equipment
- _Kadai_ | frying pan
- Lid for cooking vessel
- _Khunti_ | long spatula

## Appliances
- Stove

## Method
1. Divide the bottle gourd into 6–8 cm segments and remove its skin. Now, cut each segment into slices, 3 mm wide. Then bunch up about 3–4 of the slices at a time, and further cut them into matchsticks, 3 mm wide.
2. In a small bowl, make a paste by mixing the ginger, turmeric, cumin powder, and 25 g water. Set aside.
3. In a pan set on medium flame, add the _moong dal_.
4. Dry-roast the _dal_, stirring continuously, till it changes colour to a pinkish-brown. This should take about 4 minutes.
5. Once the _dal_ is roasted, remove it from the pan, and set aside for later.
5. To the same pan set on medium heat, add 15 g mustard oil.
6. Once the oil has started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, add in the _dal’er bori_.
7. Fry the _boris_ till they turn golden. Drain from the oil and set aside for later.
8. Temper the same oil with the dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and cumin seeds.
9. Once the whole spices have started crackling, add the ginger-turmeric-cumin paste that we prepared earlier.
10. Fry the spices till they release oil (about 4 minutes). You may add an additional 25 g water to the pan if the spices turn dry and start to stick to the bottom of the pan.
11. Once the spices have fried, add in the roasted _moong dal_ and cook everything for 2 minutes.
12. Then add all the shredded _lau_, along with the salt. Mix till the vegetable is coated with the spices.
13. Cover the pan and let the _lau_ steam for a good 20 minutes. During this time, the salt will help draw the moisture from the gourd and soften it. Don’t forget to stir occasionally to ensure that the _lau_ doesn’t stick to the pan.
14. Once the gourd is soft, add the sugar and slit green chillies. Cover and cook for another 8 minutes.
15. Break the fried _bori_ into shards and add them to the pan, along with freshly chopped coriander leaves. Cook everything for about 4 minutes before garnishing with _ghee_.
