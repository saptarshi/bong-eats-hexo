## Method
1. Weigh out the _dal_ and add it to a dry pot (preferably a _kadai_ or wok), set on medium heat.
2. Dry-roast the _dal_, stirring continuously, till it changes colour from yellow to a pinkish brown. Here, it is important to keep the _dal_ moving while it is in the pan to ensure that all surfaces of the grains roast evenly. Be particularly alert once the _dal_ has taken on a light, brown colour, as it is during this stage that the _dal_ has the tendency to burn easily.
3. Transfer the roasted _dal_ into a boiling pot immediately (do not hold it in the hot pan, as it will continue to brown when kept in contact with heat).
4. Wash and rinse the _dal_ thoroughly.
5. Add 550 g water to the washed _dal_.
6. Boil it on medium heat for about 20 minutes. While we want the _dal_ to be completely cooked, we still want the individual grains to remain unbroken. So, check frequently to ensure that the dal doesn’t turn into mush and lose its texture.
7. Chop the cauliflower into 2-cm florets, the carrot into 1-cm cubes, and the tomatoes roughly. Shell the peas and slit the green chillies.
8. Heat up the _kadai_ once more and add 10 g mustard oil.
9. Once the oil has smoked lightly and lost its pungent smell, temper it with the dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, cumin seeds, and 1 green chilli.
10. Add the carrots and stir-fry them for 1 minute.
11. Next, add the cauliflower florets and fry them for another minute.
12. Add the tomatoes and peas, one at a time, and fry them for a minute after each addition.
13. Pour in the roasted, boiled _dal_ with its water.
14. Add the salt, sugar and turmeric, and stir them in.
15. Allow the _dal_ to bubble for about 6 minutes on low heat. Don’t increase the heat level or the liquid in the _dal_ may dry up.
16. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves, a slit green chilli, [_garam masala_ powder](/recipe/bengali-garam-masala/), and _ghee_.
17. Cover the pan with a lid and allow the _dal_ to soak up the flavours from the garnish before serving.
