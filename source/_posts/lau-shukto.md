<p class="post-byline">An easy _shukto_ of bottle-gourd</p>

<p class="post-intro">This creamy, mellow, bottle-gourd appetiser is one of the quickest _shukto_ recipes, that can be cooked in under an hour with very little preparation.</p>

<span class="dropcap">I</span>n Bengali cooking, _shukto_ refers to a wide array of mild, sometimes bitter, milky curries. It is usually served as an appetiser for lunch, just after _shaak_ (greens) and before _dal_ (lentils). It opens up the palate for the oncoming spicier courses. While the most popular _shukto_ is the one made from a selection of vegetables—such as _kachkola_ (raw bananas), _sheem_ (flat beans), sweet potatoes, brinjal, _korola_ (bitter gourd), and so on—the one we show you here is made of just _lau_ or bottle gourd. In places where they are available, the tender stalks and shoots of the _lau_ are also added to the curry.

## Equipment
- _Kadai_ | frying pan
- Lid for the cooking vessel
- _Khunti_ | long spatula

## Appliances
- Grinder | _sheel-nora_ (to make poppy paste)
- Stove


## Method
1. Soak the poppy seeds in hot water for at least two hours. After that, grind them to a fine paste. When you rub some of the paste between your fingers, it should feel smooth, that is, the individual poppy seeds should not be discernable. The finer you grind the poppy seeds, the better the flavour.
2. Peel the _lau_ and cut it into 3-mm-thick matchsticks.
3. Set a pan on medium heat and add in the _lau_ along with half of the salt (about 10 g) and 30 g of water. Cover and allow the _lau_ to steam for 8 minutes. This will give the vegetable a head start while cooking.
4. Once the _lau_ is soft remove it from the pan and reserve in a bowl along with the juices.
5. Set the _kadai_ back on the heat. Wipe it dry so that when you add oil to it, it doesn’t splatter.
6. Heat 20 g vegetable oil. Once hot, drop the _dal’er bori_ and fry them till they are golden. This should take about 20 seconds. Drain them from the oil and set aside.
7. Before proceeding any further, mix 20 g water in the ginger paste and keep it ready.
8. Temper the same oil with bay leaves and mustard seeds.
9. Wait for the seeds to crackle before adding the ginger paste. Fry it for about 4 minutes.
10. Next, add the steamed _lau_ along with the reserved juices. Mix everything well.
11. At this stage, also add the remaining salt (12 g) and all of the sugar. Also stir in the poppy paste.
11. Let everything bubble for about 6 minutes on medium heat. If you find that juices are running dry, drop the heat or cover the pan.
12. Break the fried _bori_ into shards and add it to the shukto.
13. Mix the flour into the milk and add that to the shukto too. The flour will help thicken the juices and allow them to coat the _lau_.
14. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, after which add the ghee, cover, and rest before serving.
