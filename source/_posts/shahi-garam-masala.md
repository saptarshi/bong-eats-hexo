<span class="dropcap">W</span>hile the _garam masala_ used in most northern and western Indian cooking might contain everything from coriander and cumin seeds to mustard seeds, the Bengali version, in its most basic form, is made up of just cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves. The ‘_shahi_’ (meaning royal) _garam masala_ takes this basic spice blend to the next level. The inclusion of some additional aromatic spices such as mace (_joyitree_) and nutmeg (_jaiphol_) impart fragrance, while dried red chillies and black peppercorns provide a subtle bit of heat and flavour.

In Bengali cooking, _shahi garam masala_ is especially used to flavour [egg](/recipe/dimer-dalna/), [chicken](/recipe/chicken-curry/), mutton, lamb, or beef curries. Along with ghee, it may also be used as garnish for several vegetarian preparations (most _ghontos_ and [_dalna_](/tags/dalna/), and _khichuri_).

The [Bengali _garam masala_](/recipe/bengali-garam-masala/) and _shahi garam masala_ are both must-haves in the Bengali kitchen. But if you must pick just one, go the extra mile and keep a small reserve of the _shahi_ version in your arsenal. You’ll be surprised at its transformative powers.
