[_In this series, we tip our hats to some of our favourite dishes available in the restaurants, cafés, and cabins of Calcutta. Our purpose in doing so is to document their existence, and give people a way to recreate them if they happen to live away from the city. Make these at home, or hunt them down from the source—irrespective of how you get your hands on these items, we hope you enjoy them._]

<span class="dropcap">M</span>aking momo wrappers from scratch is very easy, not least because the momo dough requires only four ingredients, including water! The trick is to make a stiff dough, knead it extremely well, and rest it in a plastic bag. The dough then becomes smooth and ready to be portioned and filled with a momo filling of your choice. In this recipe for the momo dough, we take you through the steps of kneading and rolling out the wrappers to the perfect diameter and thickness. Since the edges of a momo are crimped together, we need to ensure that the sides of the wrapper are thin so that they cook at the same time as the rest of the momo. The rolling method shown in this video is a traditional one, which ensures that your momo covering turns out soft and perfectly cooked no matter what you fill it with!

We love juicy [pork momos](/recipe/pork-momo) and beef momos best.

## Ingredients
| Quantity | Ingredient                | 
|----------|---------------------------|
|    400 g | Maida (all-purpose flour) |
|      8 g | Salt                      |
|    ½ tsp | Baking powder             |
|    200 g | Warm water                |



## Equipment
- Mixing bowl
- A cylindrical rolling pin (not spindle-shaped), preferably thin.
- Plastic / Ziploc bag


## Appliances
- Stove
- Grinder
- Electric kettle (optional)


## Method
1. In a bowl, combine the flour, salt, baking powder and warm water until they more-or-less come together, after which transfer everything to a clean surface and start kneading. The dough might seem dry at first, but keep kneading continuously for about 10 minutes and it’ll start getting wetter. At this point, the dough will still appear stiff and rough. That’s okay.
2. Place the dough inside a large plastic bag or a Ziploc bag and allow it to rest for at least 60 minutes. 
3. After 60 minutes, knead the dough for about 5 seconds and you will notice that it is considerably smoother now.
4. Work in sections and reserve the ones you’re not using in a plastic bag so that they don’t dry out. Divide the dough in 12 g portions. Roll each portion using your palms into a disc. Keep these discs covered with the plastic bag until you need them. 
5. Roll out into wrappers about 9 cm in diameter as shown in [this video]('https://youtu.be/hVRRaYjjUis?t=4m1s'). 
6. Dust with flour so that the wrappers don’t stick. 
7. Fill them with a momo filling of your choice.
