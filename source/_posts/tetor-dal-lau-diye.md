<p class="post-byline">An easy-to-make, mildly bitter _moong dal_ recipe</p>

<p class="post-intro">This nutritious _moong dal_ contains healthy portions of bitter melon (_korola_) and bottle gourd (_lau_). But that doesn’t make it any less delicious.</p>

<!-- more -->
<span class="dropcap">T</span>his is a wonderful _dal_ for the spring-summer months. _Teto'r dal_, or as the _Bangals_ (Bengali immigrants from the eastern part of undivided Bengal) call it, _tita'r dal_, is light, mellow, and nutritious, to say nothing of delicious. This _dal_ gets its name from the fact that it contains _korola_ or bitter gourd; ‘_teto_’ literally means bitter.

## Ingredients
| Quantity | Ingredient              |
|----------|-------------------------|
|    100 g | Moong dal               |
|    250 g | Lau (bottle gourd)      |
|     50 g | Korola (bitter gourd)   |
|     15 g | Mustard oil             |
|     1 pc | Dried red chilli        |
|     1 pc | Bay leaf                |
|    ½ tsp | Shorshe (mustard seeds) |
|    ½ tsp | Methi (fenugreek seeds) |
|     40 g | Grated coconut          |
|     40 g | Ginger paste            |
|     13 g | Salt                    |
|     30 g | Sugar                   |
|      8 g | Ghee                    |


## Equipment
- Saucepan or boiling pot with lid
- _Kadai_ | frying pan
- _Khunti_ | long spatula

## Appliances
- Grater or grinder (to grate coconut)
- Stove


## Method
1. Wash and rinse the _moong dal_ thoroughly, and boil it with 550 g water till the _dal_ is soft. This should take about 15 minutes.
2. While the _dal_ is boiling, chop the _korola_ into 5-mm-thick rings. Peel the _lau_ and divide it in 4-cm-large chunks.
3. Transfer the _lau_ to a saucepan and add just enough water to submerge the _lau_. With the lid on, steam them on medium heat till they are 90 per cent done. This should take about 10 minutes. Remove them from the water and set aside.
4. In a _kadai_, heat 20 g mustard oil till it starts smoking lightly and changes colour to a pale yellow.
5. Add the _korola_ rings and fry them till they are golden (for about 4 minutes). Remove them from the oil and set aside.
6. Now, temper the same oil with the dried red chilli, bay leaf, mustard seeds (_shorshe_), and fenugreek seeds (_methi_).
7. Just as the _methi_ turns reddish in colour, add the grated coconut. Fry it on medium heat for about 2 minutes till it turns light brown.
8. Now add half of the ginger (that is, 20 g) to the pan, and fry it for a minute or so.
9. Add in the boiled _moong dal_, along with salt and sugar.
10. Once it has come to a boil, add the fried _korola_, boiled _lau_, and the remaining 20 g of ginger paste. This will accentuate the gingery flavours of the dish.
10. Let everything bubble for a good 6 to 7 minutes. By this point the dal should be infused with the flavours of ginger and _korola_, and the _lau_ should be fully tender.
11. Add some ghee, stir it in, cover, and let it rest for 2 minutes before serving.
