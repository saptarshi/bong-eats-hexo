<p class="post-byline">Crispy, golden cauliflower fritters</p>

<p class="post-intro">In all their batter-fried goodness, these humble fritters are sure to brighten up your meal.</p>

<!-- more -->
<span class="dropcap">P</span>_hulkopi’r bora_ are ideal to make in the gorgeous winter months, when the cauliflower is in season. They are so easy to prepare that they make for excellent last-minute addition to the day’s menu. The batter is simple. It is flour and water, mildly seasoned with some salt, sugar, and green chillies. _Kaalo jeere_ provides a subtle fragrance, while _posto_ adds crunch. We top batter off with a bit of raw, pungent mustard oil for crispiness. Golden-brown and crisp from the outside, and soft inside, these fried _phulkopi'r bora_ are best had with some [hot rice](/how-to/cook-the-perfect-rice/) and [dal](/tags/dal/), although they make a pretty good afternoon snack too.

|  1 pinch | Kaalo jeere (nigella seeds)     |
|      2 g | Posto (poppy seeds)             |
|  1 piece | green chilli (finely chopped)   |
|      5 g | Mustard oil                     |
|     75 g | Water                           |
|  ~ 250 g | Vegetable oil (for deep-frying) |

## Equipment
- Mixing bowl
- Sauce pan | boiling pot (with lid)
- _Kadai_ | frying pan
- Forks
- _Jhhajhhri_ | perforated spoon

## Appliances
- Stove

## Method
1. Divide the cauliflower into florets, 3 cm large, and transfer them to a saucepan.
2. Add hot water to the pan and steam the florets, with the lid on, for 3 minutes. Remember, we don’t want to cook the cauliflower completely at this stage. The florets will be deep-fried later; we just want to give them a head-start. Three minutes of steaming should do the trick.
3. Drain the florets immediately and set aside to cool.
4. Meanwhile, prepare a batter by mixing flour, salt, sugar, turmeric, _kaalo jeere_, _posto_, green chilli, mustard oil, and water in the given proportions.
5. Mix the batter till well combined.
6. Set a _kadai_ on the stove and heat it up. Add vegetable oil to the pan, at least 4 cm deep.
7. On medium flame, allow the oil to heat up completely (200 degree C). You can check by dropping some batter into the oil, and if it floats to the top immediately, with bubbles all around it, the oil is good to go.
8. Dunk the steamed cauliflower florets into the batter one at a time and coat them well.
9. Gently drop them into the oil. You can fry about 4 to 8 florets at a time, depending on the size of your pan. But be sure not to overcrowd the pan, or the florets won’t fry evenly from all sides.
10. Turning them over occasionally, fry the fritters till they are golden-brown.
11. Once done, remove them from the oil with the help of a perforated spoon. The best way to drain oil is by holding the _boras_ against the side of the hot pan for about 20 seconds.
12. Sprinkle with some rock salt (_beet noon_) and serve immediately.
