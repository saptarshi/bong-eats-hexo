<p class="post-byline">A light, airy tea-time snack from Calcutta’s legendary Coffee House</p>

<p class="post-intro">This step-by-step recipe walks you through the process of making the perfect, crunchy _jhuri alu bhaja_.</p>

<!-- more -->
<span class="dropcap"></span>_huri alu bhaja_ needs no qualification to occupy a spot in the Bengali cooking canon. Crispy, fried potato juliennes—served alongside some steaming rice, hot _dal_, and a wedge of lemon—tend to justify their own existence.
</p>
<p>For this recipe, we’ve borrowed the principles of French-fry making, and applied them to _jhuri alu bhaja_. Three important things need to be kept in mind: (1) The cut potatoes should be washed in plenty of water to rid them of starch; (2) before frying, the potatoes must be thoroughly dried—any moisture will yield limp fries; and (3) the potato juliennes must be fried in a pan full of oil, at a steady temperature of 180°C (that is, the oil should be hot, but not so hot that it begins to smoke).</p>

<p>Without further ado, let’s get into the step-by-step guide to making the perfectly crisp _jhuri alu bhaja_ every single time.</p>

**COOKING TIME** 20 minutes   
**YIELDS** 6 triangles

## Ingredients
| Quantity | Ingredient               |
|----------|--------------------------|
| 2 pieces | Eggs (boiled and peeled) |
|     30 g | Butter (softened)        |
|    ¼ tsp | Pepper (freshly crushed) |
|      2 g | Salt                     |

## Method
1. Divide the softened butter into small cubes and transfer to a mixing bowl.

3. Chop up the boiled eggs into fine pieces, and add them to the butter.
4. Add in the salt and pepper. The latter is the only flavouring used in this recipe. So make sure that the pepper is freshly ground.
5. Mix all the ingredients together till the butter and egg yolks combine to form a  creamy spread.
6. Take 50 g of this filling spread it evenly between two slices of bread.
7. Trim the edges, cut into triangles, and the sandwiches are ready to eat!  

## Served with
- Tea
- Coffee
